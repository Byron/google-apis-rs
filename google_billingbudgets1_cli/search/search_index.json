By default all output is printed to standard out, but flags can be set to direct it into a file independent of your shell's capabilities. Errors will be printed to standard error, and cause the program's exit code to be non-zero. If data-structures are requested, these will be returned as pretty-printed JSON, to be useful as input to other tools. Everything else about the CloudBillingBudget API can be found at the official documentation site . Installation and Source Code Install the command-line interface with cargo using: cargo install google-billingbudgets1-cli Find the source code on github .

If unset, it defaults to the shortest scope url for a particular method. --config-dir <folder> A directory into which we will store our persistent data. Defaults to a user-writable directory that we will create during the first invocation. [default: ~/.google-service-cli] Configuration The program will store all persistent data in the ~/.google-service-cli directory in JSON files prefixed with billingbudgets1- . You can change the directory used to store configuration with the --config-dir flag on a per-invocation basis. More information about the various kinds of persistent data are given in the following paragraphs. Authentication Most APIs require a user to authenticate any request. If this is the case, the scope determines the set of permissions granted. The granularity of these is usually no more than read-only or full-access . If not set, the system will automatically select the smallest feasible scope, e.g. when invoking a method that is read-only, it will ask only for a read-only scope. You may use the --scope flag to specify a scope directly. All applicable scopes are documented in the respective method's CLI documentation. The first time a scope is used, the user is asked for permission. Follow the instructions given by the CLI to grant permissions, or to decline. If a scope was authenticated by the user, the respective information will be stored as JSON in the configuration directory, e.g. ~/.google-service-cli/billingbudgets1-token-<scope-hash>.json . No manual management of these tokens is necessary. To revoke granted authentication, please refer to the official documentation . Application Secrets In order to allow any application to use Google services, it will need to be registered using the Google Developer Console . APIs the application may use are then enabled for it one by one. Most APIs can be used for free and have a daily quota. To allow more comfortable usage of the CLI without forcing anyone to register an own application, the CLI comes with a default application secret that is configured accordingly. This also means that heavy usage all around the world may deplete the daily quota. You can workaround this limitation by putting your own secrets file at this location: ~/.google-service-cli/billingbudgets1-secret.json , assuming that the required billingbudgets API was enabled for it. Such a secret file can be downloaded in the Google Developer Console at APIs & auth -> Credentials -> Download JSON and used as is. Learn more about how to setup Google projects and enable APIs using the official documentation . Debugging Even though the CLI does its best to provide usable error messages, sometimes it might be desirable to know what exactly led to a particular issue. This is done by allowing all client-server communication to be output to standard error as-is . The --debug flag will print errors using the Debug representation to standard error. You may consider redirecting standard error into a file for ease of use, e.g. billingbudgets1 --debug <resource> <method> [options] 2>debug.txt .","title":"Home"},{"location":"#installation-and-source-code","text":"Install the command-line interface with cargo using: cargo install google-billingbudgets1-cli Find the source code on github .","title":"Installation and Source Code"},{"location":"#usage","text":"This documentation was generated from the CloudBillingBudget API at revision 20240225 .

You can set the scope for this method like this: billingbudgets1 --scope <scope> billing-accounts budgets-create ... Required Scalar Argument <parent> (string) Required. The name of the billing account to create the budget in. Values are of the form billingAccounts/{billingAccountId} . Required Request Value The request value is a data-structure with various fields. Each field may be a simple scalar or another data-structure. In the latter case it is advised to set the field-cursor to the data-structure's field to specify values more concisely. For example, a structure like this: GoogleCloudBillingBudgetsV1Budget: amount: specified-amount: currency-code: string nanos: integer units: string budget-filter: calendar-period: string credit-types: [string] credit-types-treatment: string custom-period: end-date: day: integer month: integer year: integer start-date: day: integer month: integer year: integer projects: [string] resource-ancestors: [string] services: [string] subaccounts: [string] display-name: string etag: string name: string notifications-rule: disable-default-iam-recipients: boolean enable-project-level-recipients: boolean monitoring-notification-channels: [string] pubsub-topic: string schema-version: string ownership-scope: string can be set completely with the following arguments which are assumed to be executed in the given order. Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time. -r .amount.specified-amount currency-code=et The three-letter currency code defined in ISO 4217. nanos=68 Number of nano (10^-9) units of the amount. The value must be between -999,999,999 and +999,999,999 inclusive. If units is positive, nanos must be positive or zero. If units is zero, nanos can be positive, zero, or negative. If units is negative, nanos must be negative or zero. For example $-1.75 is represented as units =-1 and nanos =-750,000,000. units=no The whole units of the amount. For example if currencyCode is &#34;USD&#34; , then 1 unit is one US dollar. ...budget-filter calendar-period=ipsum Optional. Specifies to track usage for recurring calendar period. For example, assume that CalendarPeriod.QUARTER is set. The budget tracks usage from April 1 to June 30, when the current calendar month is April, May, June. After that, it tracks usage from July 1 to September 30 when the current calendar month is July, August, September, so on. credit-types=voluptua. Optional. If Filter.credit_types_treatment is INCLUDE_SPECIFIED_CREDITS, this is a list of credit types to be subtracted from gross cost to determine the spend for threshold calculations. See a list of acceptable credit type values . If Filter.credit_types_treatment is not INCLUDE_SPECIFIED_CREDITS, this field must be empty. Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. credit-types-treatment=at Optional. If not set, default behavior is INCLUDE_ALL_CREDITS . custom-period.end-date day=93 Day of a month. Must be from 1 to 31 and valid for the year and month, or 0 to specify a year by itself or a year and month where the day isn't significant. month=21 Month of a year. Must be from 1 to 12, or 0 to specify a year without a month and day. year=99 Year of the date. Must be from 1 to 9999, or 0 to specify a date without a year. ..start-date day=42 Day of a month. Must be from 1 to 31 and valid for the year and month, or 0 to specify a year by itself or a year and month where the day isn't significant. month=49 Month of a year.

A set of projects of the form projects/{project} , specifying that usage from only this set of projects should be included in the budget. If omitted, the report includes all usage for the billing account, regardless of which project the usage occurred on. Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. resource-ancestors=gubergren Optional. A set of folder and organization names of the form folders/{folderId} or organizations/{organizationId} , specifying that usage from only this set of folders and organizations should be included in the budget. If omitted, the budget includes all usage that the billing account pays for. If the folder or organization contains projects that are paid for by a different Cloud Billing account, the budget doesn't apply to those projects. Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. services=lorem Optional. A set of services of the form services/{service_id} , specifying that usage from only this set of services should be included in the budget. If omitted, the report includes usage for all the services. The service names are available through the Catalog API: https://cloud.google.com/billing/v1/how-tos/catalog-api. Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. subaccounts=gubergren Optional. A set of subaccounts of the form billingAccounts/{account_id} , specifying that usage from only this set of subaccounts should be included in the budget. If a subaccount is set to the name of the parent account, usage from the parent account is included. If the field is omitted, the report includes usage from the parent account and all subaccounts, if they exist. Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. .. display-name=eos User data for display name in UI. The name must be less than or equal to 60 characters. etag=dolor Optional. Etag to validate that the object is unchanged for a read-modify-write operation. An empty etag causes an update to overwrite other changes. name=ea Output only. Resource name of the budget. The resource name implies the scope of a budget. Values are of the form billingAccounts/{billingAccountId}/budgets/{budgetId} . notifications-rule disable-default-iam-recipients=true Optional. When set to true, disables default notifications sent when a threshold is exceeded. Default notifications are sent to those with Billing Account Administrator and Billing Account User IAM roles for the target account. enable-project-level-recipients=false Optional. When set to true, and when the budget has a single project configured, notifications will be sent to project level recipients of that project. This field will be ignored if the budget has multiple or no project configured. Currently, project level recipients are the users with Owner role on a cloud project. monitoring-notification-channels=amet Optional. Email targets to send notifications to when a threshold is exceeded. This is in addition to the DefaultIamRecipients who receive alert emails based on their billing account IAM role. The value is the full REST resource name of a Cloud Monitoring email notification channel with the form projects/{project_id}/notificationChannels/{channel_id} . A maximum of 5 email notifications are allowed. To customize budget alert email recipients with monitoring notification channels, you must create the monitoring notification channels before you link them to a budget . For guidance on setting up notification channels to use with budgets, see Customize budget alert email recipients . For Cloud Billing budget alerts, you must use email notification channels . The other types of notification channels are not supported, such as Slack, SMS, or PagerDuty. If you want to send budget notifications to Slack , use a pubsubTopic and configure programmatic notifications . Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. pubsub-topic=duo Optional. The name of the Pub/Sub topic where budget-related messages are published, in the form projects/{project_id}/topics/{topic_id} . Updates are sent to the topic at regular intervals; the timing of the updates is not dependent on the threshold rules you've set. Note that if you want your Pub/Sub JSON object to contain data for alertThresholdExceeded , you need at least one alert threshold rule . When you set threshold rules, you must also enable at least one of the email notification options, either using the default IAM recipients or Cloud Monitoring email notification channels. To use Pub/Sub topics with budgets, you must do the following: 1. Create the Pub/Sub topic before connecting it to your budget. For guidance, see Manage programmatic budget alert notifications . 2. Grant the API caller the pubsub.topics.setIamPolicy permission on the Pub/Sub topic. If not set, the API call fails with PERMISSION_DENIED. For additional details on Pub/Sub roles and permissions, see Permissions required for this task . schema-version=ipsum Optional. Required when NotificationsRule.pubsub_topic is set. The schema version of the notification sent to NotificationsRule.pubsub_topic. Only \"1.0\" is accepted. It represents the JSON schema as defined in https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/budgets-programmatic-notifications#notification_format. .. ownership-scope=sed No description provided. About Cursors The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. . Each additional . moves it up one additional level. E.g. ... would go three levels up. Optional Output Flags The method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default. -o out out specifies the destination to which to write the server's result to. It will be a JSON-encoded structure. The destination may be - to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes. If unset, it defaults to standard output.

Required Request Value The request value is a data-structure with various fields. Each field may be a simple scalar or another data-structure. In the latter case it is advised to set the field-cursor to the data-structure's field to specify values more concisely. For example, a structure like this: GoogleCloudBillingBudgetsV1Budget: amount: specified-amount: currency-code: string nanos: integer units: string budget-filter: calendar-period: string credit-types: [string] credit-types-treatment: string custom-period: end-date: day: integer month: integer year: integer start-date: day: integer month: integer year: integer projects: [string] resource-ancestors: [string] services: [string] subaccounts: [string] display-name: string etag: string name: string notifications-rule: disable-default-iam-recipients: boolean enable-project-level-recipients: boolean monitoring-notification-channels: [string] pubsub-topic: string schema-version: string ownership-scope: string can be set completely with the following arguments which are assumed to be executed in the given order. Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time. -r .amount.specified-amount currency-code=ut The three-letter currency code defined in ISO 4217. nanos=89 Number of nano (10^-9) units of the amount. The value must be between -999,999,999 and +999,999,999 inclusive. If units is positive, nanos must be positive or zero. If units is zero, nanos can be positive, zero, or negative. If units is negative, nanos must be negative or zero. For example $-1.75 is represented as units =-1 and nanos =-750,000,000. units=rebum. The whole units of the amount. For example if currencyCode is &#34;USD&#34; , then 1 unit is one US dollar. ...budget-filter calendar-period=est Optional. Specifies to track usage for recurring calendar period. For example, assume that CalendarPeriod.QUARTER is set. The budget tracks usage from April 1 to June 30, when the current calendar month is April, May, June. After that, it tracks usage from July 1 to September 30 when the current calendar month is July, August, September, so on. credit-types=ipsum Optional. If Filter.credit_types_treatment is INCLUDE_SPECIFIED_CREDITS, this is a list of credit types to be subtracted from gross cost to determine the spend for threshold calculations. See a list of acceptable credit type values . If Filter.credit_types_treatment is not INCLUDE_SPECIFIED_CREDITS, this field must be empty. Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. credit-types-treatment=ipsum Optional. If not set, default behavior is INCLUDE_ALL_CREDITS . custom-period.end-date day=94 Day of a month. Must be from 1 to 31 and valid for the year and month, or 0 to specify a year by itself or a year and month where the day isn't significant. month=39 Month of a year. Must be from 1 to 12, or 0 to specify a year without a month and day. year=84 Year of the date. Must be from 1 to 9999, or 0 to specify a date without a year. ..start-date day=2 Day of a month. Must be from 1 to 31 and valid for the year and month, or 0 to specify a year by itself or a year and month where the day isn't significant. month=45 Month of a year.

A set of projects of the form projects/{project} , specifying that usage from only this set of projects should be included in the budget. If omitted, the report includes all usage for the billing account, regardless of which project the usage occurred on. Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. resource-ancestors=sed Optional. A set of folder and organization names of the form folders/{folderId} or organizations/{organizationId} , specifying that usage from only this set of folders and organizations should be included in the budget. If omitted, the budget includes all usage that the billing account pays for. If the folder or organization contains projects that are paid for by a different Cloud Billing account, the budget doesn't apply to those projects. Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. services=duo Optional. A set of services of the form services/{service_id} , specifying that usage from only this set of services should be included in the budget. If omitted, the report includes usage for all the services. The service names are available through the Catalog API: https://cloud.google.com/billing/v1/how-tos/catalog-api. Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. subaccounts=sed Optional. A set of subaccounts of the form billingAccounts/{account_id} , specifying that usage from only this set of subaccounts should be included in the budget. If a subaccount is set to the name of the parent account, usage from the parent account is included. If the field is omitted, the report includes usage from the parent account and all subaccounts, if they exist. Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. .. display-name=no User data for display name in UI. The name must be less than or equal to 60 characters. etag=stet Optional. Etag to validate that the object is unchanged for a read-modify-write operation. An empty etag causes an update to overwrite other changes. name=kasd Output only. Resource name of the budget. The resource name implies the scope of a budget. Values are of the form billingAccounts/{billingAccountId}/budgets/{budgetId} . notifications-rule disable-default-iam-recipients=true Optional. When set to true, disables default notifications sent when a threshold is exceeded. Default notifications are sent to those with Billing Account Administrator and Billing Account User IAM roles for the target account. enable-project-level-recipients=true Optional. When set to true, and when the budget has a single project configured, notifications will be sent to project level recipients of that project. This field will be ignored if the budget has multiple or no project configured. Currently, project level recipients are the users with Owner role on a cloud project. monitoring-notification-channels=vero Optional. Email targets to send notifications to when a threshold is exceeded. This is in addition to the DefaultIamRecipients who receive alert emails based on their billing account IAM role. The value is the full REST resource name of a Cloud Monitoring email notification channel with the form projects/{project_id}/notificationChannels/{channel_id} . A maximum of 5 email notifications are allowed. To customize budget alert email recipients with monitoring notification channels, you must create the monitoring notification channels before you link them to a budget . For guidance on setting up notification channels to use with budgets, see Customize budget alert email recipients . For Cloud Billing budget alerts, you must use email notification channels . The other types of notification channels are not supported, such as Slack, SMS, or PagerDuty. If you want to send budget notifications to Slack , use a pubsubTopic and configure programmatic notifications . Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. pubsub-topic=erat Optional. The name of the Pub/Sub topic where budget-related messages are published, in the form projects/{project_id}/topics/{topic_id} . Updates are sent to the topic at regular intervals; the timing of the updates is not dependent on the threshold rules you've set. Note that if you want your Pub/Sub JSON object to contain data for alertThresholdExceeded , you need at least one alert threshold rule . When you set threshold rules, you must also enable at least one of the email notification options, either using the default IAM recipients or Cloud Monitoring email notification channels. To use Pub/Sub topics with budgets, you must do the following: 1. Create the Pub/Sub topic before connecting it to your budget. For guidance, see Manage programmatic budget alert notifications . 2. Grant the API caller the pubsub.topics.setIamPolicy permission on the Pub/Sub topic. If not set, the API call fails with PERMISSION_DENIED. For additional details on Pub/Sub roles and permissions, see Permissions required for this task . schema-version=sed Optional. Required when NotificationsRule.pubsub_topic is set. The schema version of the notification sent to NotificationsRule.pubsub_topic. Only \"1.0\" is accepted. It represents the JSON schema as defined in https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/budgets-programmatic-notifications#notification_format. .. ownership-scope=duo No description provided. About Cursors The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. . Each additional . moves it up one additional level. E.g. ... would go three levels up. Optional Output Flags The method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default. -o out out specifies the destination to which to write the server's result to. It will be a JSON-encoded structure. The destination may be - to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes. If unset, it defaults to standard output.

Email targets to send notifications to when a threshold is exceeded. This is in addition to the DefaultIamRecipients who receive alert emails based on their billing account IAM role. The value is the full REST resource name of a Cloud Monitoring email notification channel with the form projects/{project_id}/notificationChannels/{channel_id} . A maximum of 5 email notifications are allowed. To customize budget alert email recipients with monitoring notification channels, you must create the monitoring notification channels before you link them to a budget . For guidance on setting up notification channels to use with budgets, see Customize budget alert email recipients . For Cloud Billing budget alerts, you must use email notification channels . The other types of notification channels are not supported, such as Slack, SMS, or PagerDuty. If you want to send budget notifications to Slack , use a pubsubTopic and configure programmatic notifications . Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. pubsub-topic=erat Optional. The name of the Pub/Sub topic where budget-related messages are published, in the form projects/{project_id}/topics/{topic_id} . Updates are sent to the topic at regular intervals; the timing of the updates is not dependent on the threshold rules you've set. Note that if you want your Pub/Sub JSON object to contain data for alertThresholdExceeded , you need at least one alert threshold rule . When you set threshold rules, you must also enable at least one of the email notification options, either using the default IAM recipients or Cloud Monitoring email notification channels. To use Pub/Sub topics with budgets, you must do the following: 1. Create the Pub/Sub topic before connecting it to your budget. For guidance, see Manage programmatic budget alert notifications . 2. Grant the API caller the pubsub.topics.setIamPolicy permission on the Pub/Sub topic. If not set, the API call fails with PERMISSION_DENIED. For additional details on Pub/Sub roles and permissions, see Permissions required for this task . schema-version=sed Optional. Required when NotificationsRule.pubsub_topic is set. The schema version of the notification sent to NotificationsRule.pubsub_topic. Only \"1.0\" is accepted.
