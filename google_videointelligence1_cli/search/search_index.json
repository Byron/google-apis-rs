By default all output is printed to standard out, but flags can be set to direct it into a file independent of your shell's capabilities. Errors will be printed to standard error, and cause the program's exit code to be non-zero. If data-structures are requested, these will be returned as pretty-printed JSON, to be useful as input to other tools. Everything else about the Cloud Video Intelligence API can be found at the official documentation site . Installation and Source Code Install the command-line interface with cargo using: cargo install google-videointelligence1-cli Find the source code on github . Usage This documentation was generated from the Cloud Video Intelligence API at revision 20240118 .

Each scope requires the user to grant this application permission to use it. If unset, it defaults to the shortest scope url for a particular method. --config-dir <folder> A directory into which we will store our persistent data. Defaults to a user-writable directory that we will create during the first invocation. [default: ~/.google-service-cli] Configuration The program will store all persistent data in the ~/.google-service-cli directory in JSON files prefixed with videointelligence1- . You can change the directory used to store configuration with the --config-dir flag on a per-invocation basis. More information about the various kinds of persistent data are given in the following paragraphs. Authentication Most APIs require a user to authenticate any request. If this is the case, the scope determines the set of permissions granted. The granularity of these is usually no more than read-only or full-access . If not set, the system will automatically select the smallest feasible scope, e.g. when invoking a method that is read-only, it will ask only for a read-only scope. You may use the --scope flag to specify a scope directly. All applicable scopes are documented in the respective method's CLI documentation. The first time a scope is used, the user is asked for permission. Follow the instructions given by the CLI to grant permissions, or to decline. If a scope was authenticated by the user, the respective information will be stored as JSON in the configuration directory, e.g. ~/.google-service-cli/videointelligence1-token-<scope-hash>.json . No manual management of these tokens is necessary. To revoke granted authentication, please refer to the official documentation . Application Secrets In order to allow any application to use Google services, it will need to be registered using the Google Developer Console . APIs the application may use are then enabled for it one by one. Most APIs can be used for free and have a daily quota. To allow more comfortable usage of the CLI without forcing anyone to register an own application, the CLI comes with a default application secret that is configured accordingly. This also means that heavy usage all around the world may deplete the daily quota. You can workaround this limitation by putting your own secrets file at this location: ~/.google-service-cli/videointelligence1-secret.json , assuming that the required videointelligence API was enabled for it. Such a secret file can be downloaded in the Google Developer Console at APIs & auth -> Credentials -> Download JSON and used as is. Learn more about how to setup Google projects and enable APIs using the official documentation . Debugging Even though the CLI does its best to provide usable error messages, sometimes it might be desirable to know what exactly led to a particular issue. This is done by allowing all client-server communication to be output to standard error as-is . The --debug flag will print errors using the Debug representation to standard error. You may consider redirecting standard error into a file for ease of use, e.g. videointelligence1 --debug <resource> <method> [options] 2>debug.txt .","title":"Home"},{"location":"#installation-and-source-code","text":"Install the command-line interface with cargo using: cargo install google-videointelligence1-cli Find the source code on github .","title":"Installation and Source Code"},{"location":"#usage","text":"This documentation was generated from the Cloud Video Intelligence API at revision 20240118 .

If unspecified, defaults to SHOT_MODE . model=gubergren Model to use for label detection. Supported values: \"builtin/stable\" (the default if unset) and \"builtin/latest\". stationary-camera=true Whether the video has been shot from a stationary (i.e., non-moving) camera.

For file formats, such as MXF or MKV, supporting multiple audio tracks, specify up to two tracks. Default: track 0. Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. diarization-speaker-count=8 Optional. If set, specifies the estimated number of speakers in the conversation. If not set, defaults to '2'. Ignored unless enable_speaker_diarization is set to true. enable-automatic-punctuation=true Optional. If 'true', adds punctuation to recognition result hypotheses. This feature is only available in select languages. Setting this for requests in other languages has no effect at all. The default 'false' value does not add punctuation to result hypotheses. NOTE: \"This is currently offered as an experimental service, complimentary to all users. In the future this may be exclusively available as a premium feature.\" enable-speaker-diarization=true Optional. If 'true', enables speaker detection for each recognized word in the top alternative of the recognition result using a speaker_tag provided in the WordInfo. Note: When this is true, we send all the words from the beginning of the audio for the top alternative in every consecutive response. This is done in order to improve our speaker tags as our models learn to identify the speakers in the conversation over time. enable-word-confidence=true Optional. If true , the top result includes a list of words and the confidence for those words. If false , no word-level confidence information is returned. The default is false . filter-profanity=true Optional. If set to true , the server will attempt to filter out profanities, replacing all but the initial character in each filtered word with asterisks, e.g. \"f***\". If set to false or omitted, profanities won't be filtered out. language-code=ea Required. Required The language of the supplied audio as a BCP-47 language tag. Example: \"en-US\". See Language Support for a list of the currently supported language codes. max-alternatives=2 Optional. Maximum number of recognition hypotheses to be returned. Specifically, the maximum number of SpeechRecognitionAlternative messages within each SpeechTranscription . The server may return fewer than max_alternatives . Valid values are 0 - 30 . A value of 0 or 1 will return a maximum of one. If omitted, will return a maximum of one. ..text-detection-config language-hints=lorem Language hint can be specified if the language to be detected is known a priori. It can increase the accuracy of the detection. Language hint must be language code in BCP-47 format. Automatic language detection is performed if no hint is provided. Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. model=eos Model to use for text detection. Supported values: \"builtin/stable\" (the default if unset) and \"builtin/latest\". About Cursors The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. . Each additional . moves it up one additional level. E.g. ... would go three levels up.
