By default all output is printed to standard out, but flags can be set to direct it into a file independent of your shell's capabilities. Errors will be printed to standard error, and cause the program's exit code to be non-zero. If data-structures are requested, these will be returned as pretty-printed JSON, to be useful as input to other tools. Everything else about the Apigee API can be found at the official documentation site . Installation and Source Code Install the command-line interface with cargo using: cargo install google-apigee1-cli Find the source code on github . Usage This documentation was generated from the Apigee API at revision 20240222 . The CLI is at version 5.0.4 . apigee1 [options] hybrid issuers-list <name> [-p <v>]...

[-o <out>] apigee1 --help Configuration: [--scope <url>]... Specify the authentication a method should be executed in. Each scope requires the user to grant this application permission to use it. If unset, it defaults to the shortest scope url for a particular method. --config-dir <folder> A directory into which we will store our persistent data. Defaults to a user-writable directory that we will create during the first invocation. [default: ~/.google-service-cli] Configuration The program will store all persistent data in the ~/.google-service-cli directory in JSON files prefixed with apigee1- . You can change the directory used to store configuration with the --config-dir flag on a per-invocation basis. More information about the various kinds of persistent data are given in the following paragraphs. Authentication Most APIs require a user to authenticate any request. If this is the case, the scope determines the set of permissions granted. The granularity of these is usually no more than read-only or full-access . If not set, the system will automatically select the smallest feasible scope, e.g. when invoking a method that is read-only, it will ask only for a read-only scope. You may use the --scope flag to specify a scope directly. All applicable scopes are documented in the respective method's CLI documentation. The first time a scope is used, the user is asked for permission. Follow the instructions given by the CLI to grant permissions, or to decline. If a scope was authenticated by the user, the respective information will be stored as JSON in the configuration directory, e.g. ~/.google-service-cli/apigee1-token-<scope-hash>.json . No manual management of these tokens is necessary. To revoke granted authentication, please refer to the official documentation . Application Secrets In order to allow any application to use Google services, it will need to be registered using the Google Developer Console . APIs the application may use are then enabled for it one by one. Most APIs can be used for free and have a daily quota. To allow more comfortable usage of the CLI without forcing anyone to register an own application, the CLI comes with a default application secret that is configured accordingly. This also means that heavy usage all around the world may deplete the daily quota. You can workaround this limitation by putting your own secrets file at this location: ~/.google-service-cli/apigee1-secret.json , assuming that the required apigee API was enabled for it. Such a secret file can be downloaded in the Google Developer Console at APIs & auth -> Credentials -> Download JSON and used as is. Learn more about how to setup Google projects and enable APIs using the official documentation . Debugging Even though the CLI does its best to provide usable error messages, sometimes it might be desirable to know what exactly led to a particular issue. This is done by allowing all client-server communication to be output to standard error as-is . The --debug flag will print errors using the Debug representation to standard error. You may consider redirecting standard error into a file for ease of use, e.g. apigee1 --debug <resource> <method> [options] 2>debug.txt .","title":"Home"},{"location":"#installation-and-source-code","text":"Install the command-line interface with cargo using: cargo install google-apigee1-cli Find the source code on github .","title":"Installation and Source Code"},{"location":"#usage","text":"This documentation was generated from the Apigee API at revision 20240222 .

If not set, the system will automatically select the smallest feasible scope, e.g. when invoking a method that is read-only, it will ask only for a read-only scope. You may use the --scope flag to specify a scope directly. All applicable scopes are documented in the respective method's CLI documentation. The first time a scope is used, the user is asked for permission. Follow the instructions given by the CLI to grant permissions, or to decline. If a scope was authenticated by the user, the respective information will be stored as JSON in the configuration directory, e.g. ~/.google-service-cli/apigee1-token-<scope-hash>.json .

To allow more comfortable usage of the CLI without forcing anyone to register an own application, the CLI comes with a default application secret that is configured accordingly. This also means that heavy usage all around the world may deplete the daily quota. You can workaround this limitation by putting your own secrets file at this location: ~/.google-service-cli/apigee1-secret.json , assuming that the required apigee API was enabled for it.

Apigee recommends that you start with a simple API product including only required elements. You then provision credentials to apps to enable them to start testing your APIs.

Valid values include proxy or remoteservice . Defaults to proxy . Set to proxy when Apigee API proxies are associated with the API product. Set to remoteservice when non-Apigee proxies like Istio-Envoy are associated with the API product. .. proxies=sit Comma-separated list of API proxy names to which this API product is bound. By specifying API proxies, you can associate resources in the API product with specific API proxies, preventing developers from accessing those resources through other API proxies. Apigee rejects requests to API proxies that are not listed. Note: The API proxy names must already exist in the specified environment as they will be validated upon creation. Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. quota=et Number of request messages permitted per app by this API product for the specified quotaInterval and quotaTimeUnit . For example, a quota of 50, for a quotaInterval of 12 and a quotaTimeUnit of hours means 50 requests are allowed every 12 hours. quota-counter-scope=-39 Scope of the quota decides how the quota counter gets applied and evaluate for quota violation. If the Scope is set as PROXY, then all the operations defined for the APIproduct that are associated with the same proxy will share the same quota counter set at the APIproduct level, making it a global counter at a proxy level. If the Scope is set as OPERATION, then each operations get the counter set at the API product dedicated, making it a local counter. Note that, the QuotaCounterScope applies only when an operation does not have dedicated quota set for itself. quota-interval=aliquyam Time interval over which the number of request messages is calculated. quota-time-unit=ipsum Time unit defined for the quotaInterval . Valid values include minute , hour , day , or month . scopes=et Comma-separated list of OAuth scopes that are validated at runtime. Apigee validates that the scopes in any access token presented match the scopes defined in the OAuth policy associated with the API product.

About Cursors The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. .

About Cursors The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. . Each additional . moves it up one additional level. E.g. ... would go three levels up.

If a developer app is revoked, none of its API keys are valid for API calls even though the keys are still approved. If successful, the API call returns the following HTTP status code: 204 No Content To generate a new consumer key and secret for a developer app, pass the new key/secret details. Rather than replace an existing key, this API generates a new key. In this case, multiple key pairs may be associated with a single developer app. Each key pair has an independent status ( approve or revoke ) and expiration time. Any approved, non-expired key can be used in an API call. For example, if you're using API key rotation, you can generate new keys with expiration times that overlap keys that are going to expire. You might also generate a new consumer key/secret if the security of the original key/secret is compromised. The keyExpiresIn property defines the expiration time for the API key in milliseconds. If you don't set this property or set it to -1 , the API key never expires. Notes : * When generating a new key/secret, this API replaces the existing attributes, notes, and callback URLs with those specified in the request.

Each field may be a simple scalar or another data-structure. In the latter case it is advised to set the field-cursor to the data-structure's field to specify values more concisely. For example, a structure like this: GoogleCloudApigeeV1DeveloperAppKey: consumer-key: string consumer-secret: string expires-at: string expires-in-seconds: string issued-at: string scopes: [string] status: string can be set completely with the following arguments which are assumed to be executed in the given order. Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time. -r . consumer-key=stet Consumer key. consumer-secret=gubergren Secret key. expires-at=ipsum Time the developer app expires in milliseconds since epoch. expires-in-seconds=no Input only. Expiration time, in seconds, for the consumer key. If not set or left to the default value of -1 , the API key never expires. The expiration time can't be updated after it is set. issued-at=sit Time the developer app was created in milliseconds since epoch. scopes=kasd Scopes to apply to the app. The specified scope names must already be defined for the API product that you associate with the app. Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. status=amet Status of the credential. Valid values include approved or revoked . About Cursors The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. . Each additional . moves it up one additional level. E.g. ... would go three levels up. Optional Output Flags The method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default. -o out out specifies the destination to which to write the server's result to. It will be a JSON-encoded structure. The destination may be - to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes. If unset, it defaults to standard output. Optional Method Properties You may set the following properties to further configure the call. Please note that -p is followed by one or more key-value-pairs, and is called like this -p k1=v1 k2=v2 even though the listing below repeats the -p for completeness. -p action=string Approve or revoke the consumer key by setting this value to approve or revoke , respectively.

Each field may be a simple scalar or another data-structure. In the latter case it is advised to set the field-cursor to the data-structure's field to specify values more concisely. For example, a structure like this: GoogleCloudApigeeV1SetAddonEnablementRequest: analytics-enabled: boolean api-security-enabled: boolean can be set completely with the following arguments which are assumed to be executed in the given order. Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time. -r . analytics-enabled=false If the Analytics should be enabled in the environment. api-security-enabled=false If the API Security should be enabled in the environment. About Cursors The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. . Each additional . moves it up one additional level. E.g. ... would go three levels up.

The resource name of the API Proxy revision deployment for which to create the DebugSession. Must be of the form organizations/{organization}/environments/{environment}/apis/{api}/revisions/{revision} . Required Request Value The request value is a data-structure with various fields. Each field may be a simple scalar or another data-structure. In the latter case it is advised to set the field-cursor to the data-structure's field to specify values more concisely. For example, a structure like this: GoogleCloudApigeeV1DebugSession: count: integer create-time: string filter: string name: string timeout: string tracesize: integer validity: integer can be set completely with the following arguments which are assumed to be executed in the given order. Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time. -r . count=22 Optional. The number of request to be traced. Min = 1, Max = 15, Default = 10. create-time=ipsum Output only. The first transaction creation timestamp, recorded by UAP. filter=invidunt Optional. A conditional statement which is evaluated against the request message to determine if it should be traced.

The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. . Each additional . moves it up one additional level. E.g. ... would go three levels up.

For example, a structure like this: GoogleCloudApigeeV1ArchiveDeployment: created-at: string gcs-uri: string labels: { string: string } name: string operation: string updated-at: string can be set completely with the following arguments which are assumed to be executed in the given order. Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time. -r . created-at=amet Output only. The time at which the Archive Deployment was created in milliseconds since the epoch. gcs-uri=at Input only.

A reference to the LRO that created this Archive Deployment in the following format: organizations/{org}/operations/{id} updated-at=et Output only. The time at which the Archive Deployment was updated in milliseconds since the epoch. About Cursors The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. . Each additional . moves it up one additional level. E.g. ... would go three levels up.

Required Scalar Argument <name> (string) Name of the Archive Deployment in the following format: organizations/{org}/environments/{env}/archiveDeployments/{id} . Required Request Value The request value is a data-structure with various fields. Each field may be a simple scalar or another data-structure. In the latter case it is advised to set the field-cursor to the data-structure's field to specify values more concisely. For example, a structure like this: GoogleCloudApigeeV1ArchiveDeployment: created-at: string gcs-uri: string labels: { string: string } name: string operation: string updated-at: string can be set completely with the following arguments which are assumed to be executed in the given order. Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time. -r . created-at=erat Output only. The time at which the Archive Deployment was created in milliseconds since the epoch. gcs-uri=sit Input only.

The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. . Each additional . moves it up one additional level. E.g. ... would go three levels up. Optional Output Flags The method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default. -o out out specifies the destination to which to write the server's result to. It will be a JSON-encoded structure. The destination may be - to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes. If unset, it defaults to standard output.

The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. . Each additional . moves it up one additional level. E.g. ... would go three levels up.

You can set the scope for this method like this: apigee1 --scope <scope> organizations environments-security-reports-create ... Required Scalar Argument <parent> (string) Required. The parent resource name. Must be of the form organizations/{org}/environments/{env} . Required Request Value The request value is a data-structure with various fields. Each field may be a simple scalar or another data-structure. In the latter case it is advised to set the field-cursor to the data-structure's field to specify values more concisely. For example, a structure like this: GoogleCloudApigeeV1SecurityReportQuery: csv-delimiter: string dimensions: [string] display-name: string envgroup-hostname: string filter: string group-by-time-unit: string limit: integer mime-type: string report-definition-id: string can be set completely with the following arguments which are assumed to be executed in the given order. Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time. -r . csv-delimiter=aliquyam Delimiter used in the CSV file, if outputFormat is set to csv . Defaults to the , (comma) character. Supported delimiter characters include comma ( , ), pipe ( | ), and tab ( \\t ). dimensions=sanctus A list of dimensions. https://docs.apigee.com/api-platform/analytics/analytics-reference#dimensions Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. display-name=invidunt Security Report display name which users can specify. envgroup-hostname=dolor Hostname needs to be specified if query intends to run at host level. This field is only allowed when query is submitted by CreateHostSecurityReport where analytics data will be grouped by organization and hostname. filter=eos Boolean expression that can be used to filter data. Filter expressions can be combined using AND/OR terms and should be fully parenthesized to avoid ambiguity. See Analytics metrics, dimensions, and filters reference https://docs.apigee.com/api-platform/analytics/analytics-reference for more information on the fields available to filter on. For more information on the tokens that you use to build filter expressions, see Filter expression syntax. https://docs.apigee.com/api-platform/analytics/asynch-reports-api#filter-expression-syntax group-by-time-unit=magna Time unit used to group the result set. Valid values include: second, minute, hour, day, week, or month. If a query includes groupByTimeUnit, then the result is an aggregation based on the specified time unit and the resultant timestamp does not include milliseconds precision. If a query omits groupByTimeUnit, then the resultant timestamp includes milliseconds precision. limit=90 Maximum number of rows that can be returned in the result. mime-type=gubergren Valid values include: csv or json . Defaults to json . Note: Configure the delimiter for CSV output using the csvDelimiter property. report-definition-id=erat Report Definition ID. About Cursors The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. . Each additional . moves it up one additional level. E.g. ... would go three levels up.

In the latter case it is advised to set the field-cursor to the data-structure's field to specify values more concisely. For example, a structure like this: GoogleCloudApigeeV1QueryTabularStatsRequest: dimensions: [string] filter: string page-size: integer page-token: string time-range: end-time: string start-time: string can be set completely with the following arguments which are assumed to be executed in the given order.

Follows the same grammar as custom report's filter expressions. Example, apiproxy eq 'foobar'. https://cloud.google.com/apigee/docs/api-platform/analytics/analytics-reference#filters page-size=84 Page size represents the number of rows. page-token=lorem Identifies a sequence of rows. time-range end-time=elitr Optional. Exclusive end of the interval. If specified, a Timestamp matching this interval will have to be before the end. start-time=justo Optional. Inclusive start of the interval. If specified, a Timestamp matching this interval will have to be the same or after the start. About Cursors The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. .

Required Request Value The request value is a data-structure with various fields. Each field may be a simple scalar or another data-structure. In the latter case it is advised to set the field-cursor to the data-structure's field to specify values more concisely. For example, a structure like this: GoogleCloudApigeeV1TargetServer: description: string host: string is-enabled: boolean name: string port: integer protocol: string s-sl-info: ciphers: [string] client-auth-enabled: boolean common-name: value: string wildcard-match: boolean enabled: boolean ignore-validation-errors: boolean key-alias: string key-store: string protocols: [string] trust-store: string can be set completely with the following arguments which are assumed to be executed in the given order. Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time. -r . description=voluptua. Optional. A human-readable description of this TargetServer. host=sit Required. The host name this target connects to. Value must be a valid hostname as described by RFC-1123. is-enabled=true Optional. Enabling/disabling a TargetServer is useful when TargetServers are used in load balancing configurations, and one or more TargetServers need to taken out of rotation periodically. Defaults to true. name=eirmod Required. The resource id of this target server. Values must match the regular expression port=25 Required. The port number this target connects to on the given host. Value must be between 1 and 65535, inclusive. protocol=voluptua. Immutable. The protocol used by this TargetServer. s-sl-info ciphers=sea The SSL/TLS cipher suites to be used. For programmable proxies, it must be one of the cipher suite names listed in: http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/security/StandardNames.html#ciphersuites. For configurable proxies, it must follow the configuration specified in: https://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/chromium-boringssl-docs/ssl.h.html#Cipher-suite-configuration. This setting has no effect for configurable proxies when negotiating TLS 1.3. Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. client-auth-enabled=true Optional. Enables two-way TLS. common-name value=sea The TLS Common Name string of the certificate. wildcard-match=false Indicates whether the cert should be matched against as a wildcard cert. .. enabled=false Required. Enables TLS. If false, neither one-way nor two-way TLS will be enabled. ignore-validation-errors=false If true, Edge ignores TLS certificate errors. Valid when configuring TLS for target servers and target endpoints, and when configuring virtual hosts that use 2-way TLS. When used with a target endpoint/target server, if the backend system uses SNI and returns a cert with a subject Distinguished Name (DN) that does not match the hostname, there is no way to ignore the error and the connection fails. key-alias=tempor Required if client_auth_enabled is true. The resource ID for the alias containing the private key and cert. key-store=clita Required if client_auth_enabled is true. The resource ID of the keystore. protocols=sed The TLS versioins to be used. Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. trust-store=no The resource ID of the truststore. About Cursors The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. . Each additional . moves it up one additional level. E.g. ... would go three levels up. Optional Output Flags The method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default. -o out out specifies the destination to which to write the server's result to.

Required when BillingType is SUBSCRIPTION . When BillingType is EVALUATION , a Google-Managed encryption key will be used. Format: projects/*/locations/*/keyRings/*/cryptoKeys/* created-at=et Output only. Time that the Apigee organization was created in milliseconds since epoch. customer-name=et Not used by Apigee. description=aliquyam Description of the Apigee organization. disable-vpc-peering=false Optional. Flag that specifies whether the VPC Peering through Private Google Access should be disabled between the consumer network and Apigee. Valid only when RuntimeType is set to CLOUD. Required if an authorizedNetwork on the consumer project is not provided, in which case the flag should be set to true. The value must be set before the creation of any Apigee runtime instance and can be updated only when there are no runtime instances. Note: Apigee will be deprecating the vpc peering model that requires you to provide 'authorizedNetwork', by making the non-peering model as the default way of provisioning Apigee organization in future. So, this will be a temporary flag to enable the transition. Not supported for Apigee hybrid. display-name=tempor Display name for the Apigee organization. Unused, but reserved for future use. environments=dolore Output only. List of environments in the Apigee organization. Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. expires-at=dolore Output only. Time that the Apigee organization is scheduled for deletion. last-modified-at=ipsum Output only.
