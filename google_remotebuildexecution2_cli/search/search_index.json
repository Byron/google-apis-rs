By default all output is printed to standard out, but flags can be set to direct it into a file independent of your shell's capabilities. Errors will be printed to standard error, and cause the program's exit code to be non-zero. If data-structures are requested, these will be returned as pretty-printed JSON, to be useful as input to other tools. Everything else about the Remote Build Execution API can be found at the official documentation site . Installation and Source Code Install the command-line interface with cargo using: cargo install google-remotebuildexecution2-cli Find the source code on github . Usage This documentation was generated from the Remote Build Execution API at revision 20210329 . The CLI is at version 5.0.4 . remotebuildexecution2 [options] action-results get <instance-name> <hash> <size-bytes> [-p <v>]... [-o <out>] update <instance-name> <hash> <size-bytes> (-r <kv>)...

Each scope requires the user to grant this application permission to use it. If unset, it defaults to the shortest scope url for a particular method. --config-dir <folder> A directory into which we will store our persistent data. Defaults to a user-writable directory that we will create during the first invocation. [default: ~/.google-service-cli] Configuration The program will store all persistent data in the ~/.google-service-cli directory in JSON files prefixed with remotebuildexecution2- . You can change the directory used to store configuration with the --config-dir flag on a per-invocation basis. More information about the various kinds of persistent data are given in the following paragraphs. Authentication Most APIs require a user to authenticate any request. If this is the case, the scope determines the set of permissions granted. The granularity of these is usually no more than read-only or full-access . If not set, the system will automatically select the smallest feasible scope, e.g. when invoking a method that is read-only, it will ask only for a read-only scope. You may use the --scope flag to specify a scope directly. All applicable scopes are documented in the respective method's CLI documentation. The first time a scope is used, the user is asked for permission. Follow the instructions given by the CLI to grant permissions, or to decline. If a scope was authenticated by the user, the respective information will be stored as JSON in the configuration directory, e.g. ~/.google-service-cli/remotebuildexecution2-token-<scope-hash>.json . No manual management of these tokens is necessary. To revoke granted authentication, please refer to the official documentation . Application Secrets In order to allow any application to use Google services, it will need to be registered using the Google Developer Console . APIs the application may use are then enabled for it one by one. Most APIs can be used for free and have a daily quota. To allow more comfortable usage of the CLI without forcing anyone to register an own application, the CLI comes with a default application secret that is configured accordingly. This also means that heavy usage all around the world may deplete the daily quota. You can workaround this limitation by putting your own secrets file at this location: ~/.google-service-cli/remotebuildexecution2-secret.json , assuming that the required remotebuildexecution API was enabled for it. Such a secret file can be downloaded in the Google Developer Console at APIs & auth -> Credentials -> Download JSON and used as is. Learn more about how to setup Google projects and enable APIs using the official documentation . Debugging Even though the CLI does its best to provide usable error messages, sometimes it might be desirable to know what exactly led to a particular issue. This is done by allowing all client-server communication to be output to standard error as-is . The --debug flag will print errors using the Debug representation to standard error. You may consider redirecting standard error into a file for ease of use, e.g. remotebuildexecution2 --debug <resource> <method> [options] 2>debug.txt .","title":"Home"},{"location":"#installation-and-source-code","text":"Install the command-line interface with cargo using: cargo install google-remotebuildexecution2-cli Find the source code on github .","title":"Installation and Source Code"},{"location":"#usage","text":"This documentation was generated from the Remote Build Execution API at revision 20210329 .

Required Request Value The request value is a data-structure with various fields. Each field may be a simple scalar or another data-structure. In the latter case it is advised to set the field-cursor to the data-structure's field to specify values more concisely. For example, a structure like this: BuildBazelRemoteExecutionV2ActionResult: execution-metadata: execution-completed-timestamp: string execution-start-timestamp: string input-fetch-completed-timestamp: string input-fetch-start-timestamp: string output-upload-completed-timestamp: string output-upload-start-timestamp: string queued-timestamp: string worker: string worker-completed-timestamp: string worker-start-timestamp: string exit-code: integer stderr-digest: hash: string size-bytes: string stderr-raw: string stdout-digest: hash: string size-bytes: string stdout-raw: string can be set completely with the following arguments which are assumed to be executed in the given order.

About Cursors The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. . Each additional . moves it up one additional level. E.g. ... would go three levels up.

Generally, a lower value means a longer retention time or other advantage, but the interpretation of a given value is server-dependent. A priority of 0 means a default value, decided by the server.

In order to execute an action, the client must first upload all of the inputs, the Command to run, and the Action into the ContentAddressableStorage. It then calls Execute with an action_digest referring to them. The server will run the action and eventually return the result. The input Action 's fields MUST meet the various canonicalization requirements specified in the documentation for their types so that it has the same digest as other logically equivalent Action s. The server MAY enforce the requirements and return errors if a non-canonical input is received. It MAY also proceed without verifying some or all of the requirements, such as for performance reasons. If the server does not verify the requirement, then it will treat the Action as distinct from another logically equivalent action if they hash differently. Returns a stream of google.longrunning.Operation messages describing the resulting execution, with eventual response ExecuteResponse. The metadata on the operation is of type ExecuteOperationMetadata. If the client remains connected after the first response is returned after the server, then updates are streamed as if the client had called WaitExecution until the execution completes or the request reaches an error. The operation can also be queried using Operations API. The server NEED NOT implement other methods or functionality of the Operations API. Errors discovered during creation of the Operation will be reported as gRPC Status errors, while errors that occurred while running the action will be reported in the status field of the ExecuteResponse . The server MUST NOT set the error field of the Operation proto. The possible errors include: * INVALID_ARGUMENT : One or more arguments are invalid. * FAILED_PRECONDITION : One or more errors occurred in setting up the action requested, such as a missing input or command or no worker being available. The client may be able to fix the errors and retry. * RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED : There is insufficient quota of some resource to run the action. * UNAVAILABLE : Due to a transient condition, such as all workers being occupied (and the server does not support a queue), the action could not be started. The client should retry. * INTERNAL : An internal error occurred in the execution engine or the worker. * DEADLINE_EXCEEDED : The execution timed out. * CANCELLED : The operation was cancelled by the client. This status is only possible if the server implements the Operations API CancelOperation method, and it was called for the current execution. In the case of a missing input or command, the server SHOULD additionally send a PreconditionFailure error detail where, for each requested blob not present in the CAS, there is a Violation with a type of MISSING and a subject of &#34;blobs/{hash}/{size}&#34; indicating the digest of the missing blob. The server does not need to guarantee that a call to this method leads to at most one execution of the action. The server MAY execute the action multiple times, potentially in parallel. These redundant executions MAY continue to run, even if the operation is completed. Scopes You will need authorization for the https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform scope to make a valid call. If unset, the scope for this method defaults to https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform . You can set the scope for this method like this: remotebuildexecution2 --scope <scope> actions execute ...

For example, a structure like this: BuildBazelRemoteExecutionV2ExecuteRequest: action-digest: hash: string size-bytes: string execution-policy: priority: integer results-cache-policy: priority: integer skip-cache-lookup: boolean can be set completely with the following arguments which are assumed to be executed in the given order. Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time. -r .action-digest hash=dolor The hash. In the case of SHA-256, it will always be a lowercase hex string exactly 64 characters long. size-bytes=ea The size of the blob, in bytes. ..execution-policy priority=46 The priority (relative importance) of this action. Generally, a lower value means that the action should be run sooner than actions having a greater priority value, but the interpretation of a given value is server- dependent. A priority of 0 means the default priority. Priorities may be positive or negative, and such actions should run later or sooner than actions having the default priority, respectively. The particular semantics of this field is up to the server. In particular, every server will have their own supported range of priorities, and will decide how these map into scheduling policy. ..results-cache-policy priority=13 The priority (relative importance) of this content in the overall cache. Generally, a lower value means a longer retention time or other advantage, but the interpretation of a given value is server-dependent. A priority of 0 means a default value, decided by the server. The particular semantics of this field is up to the server. In particular, every server will have their own supported range of priorities, and will decide how these map into retention/eviction policy. .. skip-cache-lookup=true If true, the action will be executed even if its result is already present in the ActionCache. The execution is still allowed to be merged with other in-flight executions of the same action, however - semantically, the service MUST only guarantee that the results of an execution with this field set were not visible before the corresponding execution request was sent. Note that actions from execution requests setting this field set are still eligible to be entered into the action cache upon completion, and services SHOULD overwrite any existing entries that may exist. This allows skip_cache_lookup requests to be used as a mechanism for replacing action cache entries that reference outputs no longer available or that are poisoned in any way. If false, the result may be served from the action cache. About Cursors The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. . Each additional . moves it up one additional level. E.g. ... would go three levels up. Optional Output Flags The method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default. -o out out specifies the destination to which to write the server's result to. It will be a JSON-encoded structure. The destination may be - to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes. If unset, it defaults to standard output.

Optional Output Flags The method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default. -o out out specifies the destination to which to write the server's result to. It will be a JSON-encoded structure. The destination may be - to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes. If unset, it defaults to standard output. Optional Method Properties You may set the following properties to further configure the call. Please note that -p is followed by one or more key-value-pairs, and is called like this -p k1=v1 k2=v2 even though the listing below repeats the -p for completeness. -p page-size=integer A maximum page size to request. If present, the server will request no more than this many items. Regardless of whether a page size is specified, the server may place its own limit on the number of items to be returned and require the client to retrieve more items using a subsequent request. -p page-token=string A page token, which must be a value received in a previous GetTreeResponse.

Required Scalar Argument <name> (string) The name of the Operation returned by Execute. Required Request Value The request value is a data-structure with various fields. Each field may be a simple scalar or another data-structure. In the latter case it is advised to set the field-cursor to the data-structure's field to specify values more concisely. For example, a structure like this: BuildBazelRemoteExecutionV2WaitExecutionRequest: can be set completely with the following arguments which are assumed to be executed in the given order. Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time. About Cursors The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. .
