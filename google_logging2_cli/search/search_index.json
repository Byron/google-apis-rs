By default all output is printed to standard out, but flags can be set to direct it into a file independent of your shell's capabilities. Errors will be printed to standard error, and cause the program's exit code to be non-zero. If data-structures are requested, these will be returned as pretty-printed JSON, to be useful as input to other tools. Everything else about the Logging API can be found at the official documentation site . Installation and Source Code Install the command-line interface with cargo using: cargo install google-logging2-cli Find the source code on github .

[-o <out>] logging2 --help Configuration: [--scope <url>]... Specify the authentication a method should be executed in. Each scope requires the user to grant this application permission to use it. If unset, it defaults to the shortest scope url for a particular method. --config-dir <folder> A directory into which we will store our persistent data. Defaults to a user-writable directory that we will create during the first invocation. [default: ~/.google-service-cli] Configuration The program will store all persistent data in the ~/.google-service-cli directory in JSON files prefixed with logging2- . You can change the directory used to store configuration with the --config-dir flag on a per-invocation basis. More information about the various kinds of persistent data are given in the following paragraphs. Authentication Most APIs require a user to authenticate any request. If this is the case, the scope determines the set of permissions granted. The granularity of these is usually no more than read-only or full-access . If not set, the system will automatically select the smallest feasible scope, e.g. when invoking a method that is read-only, it will ask only for a read-only scope. You may use the --scope flag to specify a scope directly. All applicable scopes are documented in the respective method's CLI documentation. The first time a scope is used, the user is asked for permission. Follow the instructions given by the CLI to grant permissions, or to decline. If a scope was authenticated by the user, the respective information will be stored as JSON in the configuration directory, e.g. ~/.google-service-cli/logging2-token-<scope-hash>.json . No manual management of these tokens is necessary. To revoke granted authentication, please refer to the official documentation . Application Secrets In order to allow any application to use Google services, it will need to be registered using the Google Developer Console . APIs the application may use are then enabled for it one by one. Most APIs can be used for free and have a daily quota. To allow more comfortable usage of the CLI without forcing anyone to register an own application, the CLI comes with a default application secret that is configured accordingly. This also means that heavy usage all around the world may deplete the daily quota. You can workaround this limitation by putting your own secrets file at this location: ~/.google-service-cli/logging2-secret.json , assuming that the required logging API was enabled for it. Such a secret file can be downloaded in the Google Developer Console at APIs & auth -> Credentials -> Download JSON and used as is. Learn more about how to setup Google projects and enable APIs using the official documentation . Debugging Even though the CLI does its best to provide usable error messages, sometimes it might be desirable to know what exactly led to a particular issue. This is done by allowing all client-server communication to be output to standard error as-is . The --debug flag will print errors using the Debug representation to standard error. You may consider redirecting standard error into a file for ease of use, e.g. logging2 --debug <resource> <method> [options] 2>debug.txt .","title":"Home"},{"location":"#installation-and-source-code","text":"Install the command-line interface with cargo using: cargo install google-logging2-cli Find the source code on github .","title":"Installation and Source Code"},{"location":"#usage","text":"This documentation was generated from the Logging API at revision 20240223 .

The first time a scope is used, the user is asked for permission. Follow the instructions given by the CLI to grant permissions, or to decline.

About Cursors The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. . Each additional . moves it up one additional level. E.g. ... would go three levels up. Optional Output Flags The method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default. -o out out specifies the destination to which to write the server's result to.

The timestamp when the saved query was created. description=dolores Optional. A human readable description of the saved query. display-name=gubergren Optional. The user specified title for the SavedQuery. logging-query filter=et Required. An advanced query using the Logging Query Language (https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/view/logging-query-language). The maximum length of the filter is 20000 characters. summary-field-end=78 Characters will be counted from the end of the string. summary-field-start=23 Characters will be counted from the start of the string. .. name=dolore Output only. Resource name of the saved query.In the format: \"projects/[PROJECT_ID]/locations/[LOCATION_ID]/savedQueries/[QUERY_ID]\" For a list of supported locations, see Supported Regions (https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/region-support#bucket-regions)After the saved query is created, the location cannot be changed.If the user doesn't provide a QUERY_ID, the system will generate an alphanumeric ID. ops-analytics-query sql-query-text=dolore Required. A logs analytics SQL query, which generally follows BigQuery format.This is the SQL query that appears in the Log Analytics UI's query editor. .. update-time=dolore Output only. The timestamp when the saved query was last updated. visibility=voluptua. Required. The visibility status of this query, which determines its ownership. About Cursors The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. . Each additional . moves it up one additional level. E.g. ... would go three levels up. Optional Output Flags The method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default. -o out out specifies the destination to which to write the server's result to. It will be a JSON-encoded structure. The destination may be - to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes. If unset, it defaults to standard output. Optional Method Properties You may set the following properties to further configure the call. Please note that -p is followed by one or more key-value-pairs, and is called like this -p k1=v1 k2=v2 even though the listing below repeats the -p for completeness. -p saved-query-id=string Optional. The ID to use for the saved query, which will become the final component of the saved query's resource name.If the saved_query_id is not provided, the system will generate an alphanumeric ID.The saved_query_id is limited to 100 characters and can include only the following characters: upper and lower-case alphanumeric characters, underscores, hyphens, periods.First character has to be alphanumeric.

Each field may be a simple scalar or another data-structure. In the latter case it is advised to set the field-cursor to the data-structure's field to specify values more concisely. For example, a structure like this: LogSink: bigquery-options: use-partitioned-tables: boolean uses-timestamp-column-partitioning: boolean create-time: string description: string destination: string disabled: boolean filter: string include-children: boolean name: string output-version-format: string update-time: string writer-identity: string can be set completely with the following arguments which are assumed to be executed in the given order. Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time. -r .bigquery-options use-partitioned-tables=false Optional. Whether to use BigQuery's partition tables (https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/partitioned-tables). By default, Cloud Logging creates dated tables based on the log entries' timestamps, e.g. syslog_20170523. With partitioned tables the date suffix is no longer present and special query syntax (https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/querying-partitioned-tables) has to be used instead. In both cases, tables are sharded based on UTC timezone. uses-timestamp-column-partitioning=true Output only. True if new timestamp column based partitioning is in use, false if legacy ingress-time partitioning is in use.All new sinks will have this field set true and will use timestamp column based partitioning. If use_partitioned_tables is false, this value has no meaning and will be false. Legacy sinks using partitioned tables will have this field set to false. .. create-time=no Output only. The creation timestamp of the sink.This field may not be present for older sinks. description=est Optional. A description of this sink.The maximum length of the description is 8000 characters. destination=at Required. The export destination: \"storage.googleapis.com/[GCS_BUCKET]\" \"bigquery.googleapis.com/projects/[PROJECT_ID]/datasets/[DATASET]\" \"pubsub.googleapis.com/projects/[PROJECT_ID]/topics/[TOPIC_ID]\" \"logging.googleapis.com/projects/[PROJECT_ID]\" \"logging.googleapis.com/projects/[PROJECT_ID]/locations/[LOCATION_ID]/buckets/[BUCKET_ID]\" The sink's writer_identity, set when the sink is created, must have permission to write to the destination or else the log entries are not exported. For more information, see Exporting Logs with Sinks (https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/api/tasks/exporting-logs). disabled=true Optional. If set to true, then this sink is disabled and it does not export any log entries. filter=sit Optional. An advanced logs filter (https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/view/advanced-queries). The only exported log entries are those that are in the resource owning the sink and that match the filter.For example:logName=\"projects/[PROJECT_ID]/logs/[LOG_ID]\" AND severity>=ERROR include-children=true Optional. This field applies only to sinks owned by organizations and folders. If the field is false, the default, only the logs owned by the sink's parent resource are available for export. If the field is true, then log entries from all the projects, folders, and billing accounts contained in the sink's parent resource are also available for export. Whether a particular log entry from the children is exported depends on the sink's filter expression.For example, if this field is true, then the filter resource.type=gce_instance would export all Compute Engine VM instance log entries from all projects in the sink's parent.To only export entries from certain child projects, filter on the project part of the log name:logName:(\"projects/test-project1/\" OR \"projects/test-project2/\") AND resource.type=gce_instance name=aliquyam Output only. The client-assigned sink identifier, unique within the project.For example: \"my-syslog-errors-to-pubsub\".Sink identifiers are limited to 100 characters and can include only the following characters: upper and lower-case alphanumeric characters, underscores, hyphens, periods.First character has to be alphanumeric. output-version-format=ipsum Deprecated. This field is unused. update-time=et Output only. The last update timestamp of the sink.This field may not be present for older sinks. writer-identity=sanctus Output only. An IAM identity\u2014a service account or group\u2014under which Cloud Logging writes the exported log entries to the sink's destination. This field is either set by specifying custom_writer_identity or set automatically by sinks.create and sinks.update based on the value of unique_writer_identity in those methods.Until you grant this identity write-access to the destination, log entry exports from this sink will fail. For more information, see Granting Access for a Resource (https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/granting-roles-to-service-accounts#granting_access_to_a_service_account_for_a_resource). Consult the destination service's documentation to determine the appropriate IAM roles to assign to the identity.Sinks that have a destination that is a log bucket in the same project as the sink cannot have a writer_identity and no additional permissions are required. About Cursors The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. . Each additional . moves it up one additional level. E.g. ... would go three levels up. Optional Output Flags The method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default. -o out out specifies the destination to which to write the server's result to. It will be a JSON-encoded structure. The destination may be - to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes. If unset, it defaults to standard output. Optional Method Properties You may set the following properties to further configure the call. Please note that -p is followed by one or more key-value-pairs, and is called like this -p k1=v1 k2=v2 even though the listing below repeats the -p for completeness. -p custom-writer-identity=string Optional. A service account provided by the caller that will be used to write the log entries. The format must be serviceAccount:some@email. This field can only be specified if you are routing logs to a destination outside this sink's project. If not specified, a Logging service account will automatically be generated. -p unique-writer-identity=boolean Optional. Determines the kind of IAM identity returned as writer_identity in the new sink. If this value is omitted or set to false, and if the sink's parent is a project, then the value returned as writer_identity is the same group or service account used by Cloud Logging before the addition of writer identities to this API. The sink's destination must be in the same project as the sink itself.If this field is set to true, or if the sink is owned by a non-project resource such as an organization, then the value of writer_identity will be a service agent (https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-account-types#service-agents) used by the sinks with the same parent.

You can set the scope for this method like this: logging2 --scope <scope> billing-accounts sinks-patch ... Required Scalar Argument <sink-name> (string) Required. The full resource name of the sink to update, including the parent resource and the sink identifier: \"projects/[PROJECT_ID]/sinks/[SINK_ID]\" \"organizations/[ORGANIZATION_ID]/sinks/[SINK_ID]\" \"billingAccounts/[BILLING_ACCOUNT_ID]/sinks/[SINK_ID]\" \"folders/[FOLDER_ID]/sinks/[SINK_ID]\" For example:\"projects/my-project/sinks/my-sink\" Required Request Value The request value is a data-structure with various fields. Each field may be a simple scalar or another data-structure. In the latter case it is advised to set the field-cursor to the data-structure's field to specify values more concisely. For example, a structure like this: LogSink: bigquery-options: use-partitioned-tables: boolean uses-timestamp-column-partitioning: boolean create-time: string description: string destination: string disabled: boolean filter: string include-children: boolean name: string output-version-format: string update-time: string writer-identity: string can be set completely with the following arguments which are assumed to be executed in the given order. Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time. -r .bigquery-options use-partitioned-tables=true Optional. Whether to use BigQuery's partition tables (https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/partitioned-tables). By default, Cloud Logging creates dated tables based on the log entries' timestamps, e.g. syslog_20170523. With partitioned tables the date suffix is no longer present and special query syntax (https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/querying-partitioned-tables) has to be used instead. In both cases, tables are sharded based on UTC timezone. uses-timestamp-column-partitioning=true Output only. True if new timestamp column based partitioning is in use, false if legacy ingress-time partitioning is in use.All new sinks will have this field set true and will use timestamp column based partitioning. If use_partitioned_tables is false, this value has no meaning and will be false. Legacy sinks using partitioned tables will have this field set to false. .. create-time=et Output only. The creation timestamp of the sink.This field may not be present for older sinks. description=sed Optional. A description of this sink.The maximum length of the description is 8000 characters. destination=no Required. The export destination: \"storage.googleapis.com/[GCS_BUCKET]\" \"bigquery.googleapis.com/projects/[PROJECT_ID]/datasets/[DATASET]\" \"pubsub.googleapis.com/projects/[PROJECT_ID]/topics/[TOPIC_ID]\" \"logging.googleapis.com/projects/[PROJECT_ID]\" \"logging.googleapis.com/projects/[PROJECT_ID]/locations/[LOCATION_ID]/buckets/[BUCKET_ID]\" The sink's writer_identity, set when the sink is created, must have permission to write to the destination or else the log entries are not exported. For more information, see Exporting Logs with Sinks (https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/api/tasks/exporting-logs). disabled=false Optional. If set to true, then this sink is disabled and it does not export any log entries. filter=elitr Optional. An advanced logs filter (https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/view/advanced-queries). The only exported log entries are those that are in the resource owning the sink and that match the filter.For example:logName=\"projects/[PROJECT_ID]/logs/[LOG_ID]\" AND severity>=ERROR include-children=false Optional. This field applies only to sinks owned by organizations and folders. If the field is false, the default, only the logs owned by the sink's parent resource are available for export. If the field is true, then log entries from all the projects, folders, and billing accounts contained in the sink's parent resource are also available for export. Whether a particular log entry from the children is exported depends on the sink's filter expression.For example, if this field is true, then the filter resource.type=gce_instance would export all Compute Engine VM instance log entries from all projects in the sink's parent.To only export entries from certain child projects, filter on the project part of the log name:logName:(\"projects/test-project1/\" OR \"projects/test-project2/\") AND resource.type=gce_instance name=no Output only. The client-assigned sink identifier, unique within the project.For example: \"my-syslog-errors-to-pubsub\".Sink identifiers are limited to 100 characters and can include only the following characters: upper and lower-case alphanumeric characters, underscores, hyphens, periods.First character has to be alphanumeric. output-version-format=nonumy Deprecated. This field is unused. update-time=at Output only. The last update timestamp of the sink.This field may not be present for older sinks. writer-identity=sadipscing Output only. An IAM identity\u2014a service account or group\u2014under which Cloud Logging writes the exported log entries to the sink's destination. This field is either set by specifying custom_writer_identity or set automatically by sinks.create and sinks.update based on the value of unique_writer_identity in those methods.Until you grant this identity write-access to the destination, log entry exports from this sink will fail. For more information, see Granting Access for a Resource (https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/granting-roles-to-service-accounts#granting_access_to_a_service_account_for_a_resource). Consult the destination service's documentation to determine the appropriate IAM roles to assign to the identity.Sinks that have a destination that is a log bucket in the same project as the sink cannot have a writer_identity and no additional permissions are required. About Cursors The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. . Each additional . moves it up one additional level. E.g. ... would go three levels up. Optional Output Flags The method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default. -o out out specifies the destination to which to write the server's result to. It will be a JSON-encoded structure. The destination may be - to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes. If unset, it defaults to standard output. Optional Method Properties You may set the following properties to further configure the call. Please note that -p is followed by one or more key-value-pairs, and is called like this -p k1=v1 k2=v2 even though the listing below repeats the -p for completeness. -p custom-writer-identity=string Optional. A service account provided by the caller that will be used to write the log entries. The format must be serviceAccount:some@email. This field can only be specified if you are routing logs to a destination outside this sink's project. If not specified, a Logging service account will automatically be generated. -p unique-writer-identity=boolean Optional. See sinks.create for a description of this field. When updating a sink, the effect of this field on the value of writer_identity in the updated sink depends on both the old and new values of this field: If the old and new values of this field are both false or both true, then there is no change to the sink's writer_identity. If the old value is false and the new value is true, then writer_identity is changed to a service agent (https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-account-types#service-agents) owned by Cloud Logging. It is an error if the old value is true and the new value is set to false or defaulted to false. -p update-mask=string Optional. Field mask that specifies the fields in sink that need an update. A sink field will be overwritten if, and only if, it is in the update mask. name and output only fields cannot be updated.An empty updateMask is temporarily treated as using the following mask for backwards compatibility purposes:destination,filter,includeChildrenAt some point in the future, behavior will be removed and specifying an empty updateMask will be an error.For a detailed FieldMask definition, see https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/google.protobuf#google.protobuf.FieldMaskFor example: updateMask=filter Optional General Properties The following properties can configure any call, and are not specific to this method. -p $-xgafv=string V1 error format. -p access-token=string OAuth access token. -p alt=string Data format for response. -p callback=string JSONP -p fields=string Selector specifying which fields to include in a partial response. -p key=string API key.

The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. . Each additional . moves it up one additional level. E.g. ... would go three levels up. Optional Output Flags The method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default. -o out out specifies the destination to which to write the server's result to. It will be a JSON-encoded structure. The destination may be - to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes. If unset, it defaults to standard output. Optional Method Properties You may set the following properties to further configure the call. Please note that -p is followed by one or more key-value-pairs, and is called like this -p k1=v1 k2=v2 even though the listing below repeats the -p for completeness. -p custom-writer-identity=string Optional. A service account provided by the caller that will be used to write the log entries. The format must be serviceAccount:some@email. This field can only be specified if you are routing logs to a destination outside this sink's project. If not specified, a Logging service account will automatically be generated. -p unique-writer-identity=boolean Optional. See sinks.create for a description of this field. When updating a sink, the effect of this field on the value of writer_identity in the updated sink depends on both the old and new values of this field: If the old and new values of this field are both false or both true, then there is no change to the sink's writer_identity. If the old value is false and the new value is true, then writer_identity is changed to a service agent (https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-account-types#service-agents) owned by Cloud Logging. It is an error if the old value is true and the new value is set to false or defaulted to false. -p update-mask=string Optional. Field mask that specifies the fields in sink that need an update. A sink field will be overwritten if, and only if, it is in the update mask. name and output only fields cannot be updated.An empty updateMask is temporarily treated as using the following mask for backwards compatibility purposes:destination,filter,includeChildrenAt some point in the future, behavior will be removed and specifying an empty updateMask will be an error.For a detailed FieldMask definition, see https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/google.protobuf#google.protobuf.FieldMaskFor example: updateMask=filter Optional General Properties The following properties can configure any call, and are not specific to this method. -p $-xgafv=string V1 error format. -p access-token=string OAuth access token. -p alt=string Data format for response. -p callback=string JSONP -p fields=string Selector specifying which fields to include in a partial response. -p key=string API key.

Whether to use BigQuery's partition tables (https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/partitioned-tables). By default, Cloud Logging creates dated tables based on the log entries' timestamps, e.g. syslog_20170523. With partitioned tables the date suffix is no longer present and special query syntax (https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/querying-partitioned-tables) has to be used instead.

For more information, see Exporting Logs with Sinks (https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/api/tasks/exporting-logs). disabled=true Optional. If set to true, then this sink is disabled and it does not export any log entries. filter=et Optional. An advanced logs filter (https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/view/advanced-queries). The only exported log entries are those that are in the resource owning the sink and that match the filter.For example:logName=\"projects/[PROJECT_ID]/logs/[LOG_ID]\" AND severity>=ERROR include-children=false Optional. This field applies only to sinks owned by organizations and folders. If the field is false, the default, only the logs owned by the sink's parent resource are available for export. If the field is true, then log entries from all the projects, folders, and billing accounts contained in the sink's parent resource are also available for export. Whether a particular log entry from the children is exported depends on the sink's filter expression.For example, if this field is true, then the filter resource.type=gce_instance would export all Compute Engine VM instance log entries from all projects in the sink's parent.To only export entries from certain child projects, filter on the project part of the log name:logName:(\"projects/test-project1/\" OR \"projects/test-project2/\") AND resource.type=gce_instance name=consetetur Output only.

An IAM identity\u2014a service account or group\u2014under which Cloud Logging writes the exported log entries to the sink's destination. This field is either set by specifying custom_writer_identity or set automatically by sinks.create and sinks.update based on the value of unique_writer_identity in those methods.Until you grant this identity write-access to the destination, log entry exports from this sink will fail. For more information, see Granting Access for a Resource (https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/granting-roles-to-service-accounts#granting_access_to_a_service_account_for_a_resource). Consult the destination service's documentation to determine the appropriate IAM roles to assign to the identity.Sinks that have a destination that is a log bucket in the same project as the sink cannot have a writer_identity and no additional permissions are required.","title":"Required Request Value"},{"location":"billing-accounts_sinks-update/#about-cursors","text":"The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures.

Encryption operations that are in progress will be completed with the key that was in use when they started. Decryption operations will be completed using the key that was used at the time of encryption unless access to that key has been revoked.To disable CMEK for the Log Router, set this field to an empty string.See Enabling CMEK for Log Router (https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/routing/managed-encryption) for more information. kms-key-version-name=consetetur Output only.

It will be populated in cases where the CMEK settings are bound to a single key version.If this field is populated, the kms_key is tied to a specific CryptoKeyVersion. name=gubergren Output only. The resource name of the CMEK settings. service-account-id=dolor Output only. The service account that will be used by the Log Router to access your Cloud KMS key.Before enabling CMEK for Log Router, you must first assign the cloudkms.cryptoKeyEncrypterDecrypter role to the service account that the Log Router will use to access your Cloud KMS key.

The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. . Each additional . moves it up one additional level. E.g. ... would go three levels up.

Each field may be a simple scalar or another data-structure. In the latter case it is advised to set the field-cursor to the data-structure's field to specify values more concisely. For example, a structure like this: LogSink: bigquery-options: use-partitioned-tables: boolean uses-timestamp-column-partitioning: boolean create-time: string description: string destination: string disabled: boolean filter: string include-children: boolean name: string output-version-format: string update-time: string writer-identity: string can be set completely with the following arguments which are assumed to be executed in the given order. Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time. -r .bigquery-options use-partitioned-tables=true Optional. Whether to use BigQuery's partition tables (https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/partitioned-tables). By default, Cloud Logging creates dated tables based on the log entries' timestamps, e.g. syslog_20170523. With partitioned tables the date suffix is no longer present and special query syntax (https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/querying-partitioned-tables) has to be used instead. In both cases, tables are sharded based on UTC timezone. uses-timestamp-column-partitioning=true Output only. True if new timestamp column based partitioning is in use, false if legacy ingress-time partitioning is in use.All new sinks will have this field set true and will use timestamp column based partitioning. If use_partitioned_tables is false, this value has no meaning and will be false. Legacy sinks using partitioned tables will have this field set to false. .. create-time=est Output only. The creation timestamp of the sink.This field may not be present for older sinks. description=takimata Optional. A description of this sink.The maximum length of the description is 8000 characters. destination=dolor Required. The export destination: \"storage.googleapis.com/[GCS_BUCKET]\" \"bigquery.googleapis.com/projects/[PROJECT_ID]/datasets/[DATASET]\" \"pubsub.googleapis.com/projects/[PROJECT_ID]/topics/[TOPIC_ID]\" \"logging.googleapis.com/projects/[PROJECT_ID]\" \"logging.googleapis.com/projects/[PROJECT_ID]/locations/[LOCATION_ID]/buckets/[BUCKET_ID]\" The sink's writer_identity, set when the sink is created, must have permission to write to the destination or else the log entries are not exported. For more information, see Exporting Logs with Sinks (https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/api/tasks/exporting-logs). disabled=false Optional. If set to true, then this sink is disabled and it does not export any log entries. filter=at Optional. An advanced logs filter (https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/view/advanced-queries). The only exported log entries are those that are in the resource owning the sink and that match the filter.For example:logName=\"projects/[PROJECT_ID]/logs/[LOG_ID]\" AND severity>=ERROR include-children=false Optional. This field applies only to sinks owned by organizations and folders. If the field is false, the default, only the logs owned by the sink's parent resource are available for export. If the field is true, then log entries from all the projects, folders, and billing accounts contained in the sink's parent resource are also available for export. Whether a particular log entry from the children is exported depends on the sink's filter expression.For example, if this field is true, then the filter resource.type=gce_instance would export all Compute Engine VM instance log entries from all projects in the sink's parent.To only export entries from certain child projects, filter on the project part of the log name:logName:(\"projects/test-project1/\" OR \"projects/test-project2/\") AND resource.type=gce_instance name=justo Output only. The client-assigned sink identifier, unique within the project.For example: \"my-syslog-errors-to-pubsub\".Sink identifiers are limited to 100 characters and can include only the following characters: upper and lower-case alphanumeric characters, underscores, hyphens, periods.First character has to be alphanumeric. output-version-format=ipsum Deprecated. This field is unused. update-time=accusam Output only. The last update timestamp of the sink.This field may not be present for older sinks. writer-identity=dolores Output only. An IAM identity\u2014a service account or group\u2014under which Cloud Logging writes the exported log entries to the sink's destination. This field is either set by specifying custom_writer_identity or set automatically by sinks.create and sinks.update based on the value of unique_writer_identity in those methods.Until you grant this identity write-access to the destination, log entry exports from this sink will fail. For more information, see Granting Access for a Resource (https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/granting-roles-to-service-accounts#granting_access_to_a_service_account_for_a_resource). Consult the destination service's documentation to determine the appropriate IAM roles to assign to the identity.Sinks that have a destination that is a log bucket in the same project as the sink cannot have a writer_identity and no additional permissions are required. About Cursors The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. . Each additional . moves it up one additional level. E.g. ... would go three levels up. Optional Output Flags The method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default. -o out out specifies the destination to which to write the server's result to. It will be a JSON-encoded structure. The destination may be - to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes. If unset, it defaults to standard output.

Please note that -p is followed by one or more key-value-pairs, and is called like this -p k1=v1 k2=v2 even though the listing below repeats the -p for completeness. -p custom-writer-identity=string Optional. A service account provided by the caller that will be used to write the log entries. The format must be serviceAccount:some@email. This field can only be specified if you are routing logs to a destination outside this sink's project. If not specified, a Logging service account will automatically be generated. -p unique-writer-identity=boolean Optional. Determines the kind of IAM identity returned as writer_identity in the new sink. If this value is omitted or set to false, and if the sink's parent is a project, then the value returned as writer_identity is the same group or service account used by Cloud Logging before the addition of writer identities to this API. The sink's destination must be in the same project as the sink itself.If this field is set to true, or if the sink is owned by a non-project resource such as an organization, then the value of writer_identity will be a service agent (https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-account-types#service-agents) used by the sinks with the same parent.

Each field may be a simple scalar or another data-structure. In the latter case it is advised to set the field-cursor to the data-structure's field to specify values more concisely. For example, a structure like this: LogSink: bigquery-options: use-partitioned-tables: boolean uses-timestamp-column-partitioning: boolean create-time: string description: string destination: string disabled: boolean filter: string include-children: boolean name: string output-version-format: string update-time: string writer-identity: string can be set completely with the following arguments which are assumed to be executed in the given order. Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time. -r .bigquery-options use-partitioned-tables=false Optional. Whether to use BigQuery's partition tables (https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/partitioned-tables). By default, Cloud Logging creates dated tables based on the log entries' timestamps, e.g. syslog_20170523. With partitioned tables the date suffix is no longer present and special query syntax (https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/querying-partitioned-tables) has to be used instead. In both cases, tables are sharded based on UTC timezone. uses-timestamp-column-partitioning=true Output only. True if new timestamp column based partitioning is in use, false if legacy ingress-time partitioning is in use.All new sinks will have this field set true and will use timestamp column based partitioning. If use_partitioned_tables is false, this value has no meaning and will be false. Legacy sinks using partitioned tables will have this field set to false. .. create-time=diam Output only. The creation timestamp of the sink.This field may not be present for older sinks. description=sea Optional. A description of this sink.The maximum length of the description is 8000 characters. destination=ipsum Required. The export destination: \"storage.googleapis.com/[GCS_BUCKET]\" \"bigquery.googleapis.com/projects/[PROJECT_ID]/datasets/[DATASET]\" \"pubsub.googleapis.com/projects/[PROJECT_ID]/topics/[TOPIC_ID]\" \"logging.googleapis.com/projects/[PROJECT_ID]\" \"logging.googleapis.com/projects/[PROJECT_ID]/locations/[LOCATION_ID]/buckets/[BUCKET_ID]\" The sink's writer_identity, set when the sink is created, must have permission to write to the destination or else the log entries are not exported. For more information, see Exporting Logs with Sinks (https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/api/tasks/exporting-logs). disabled=true Optional. If set to true, then this sink is disabled and it does not export any log entries. filter=ipsum Optional. An advanced logs filter (https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/view/advanced-queries). The only exported log entries are those that are in the resource owning the sink and that match the filter.For example:logName=\"projects/[PROJECT_ID]/logs/[LOG_ID]\" AND severity>=ERROR include-children=true Optional. This field applies only to sinks owned by organizations and folders. If the field is false, the default, only the logs owned by the sink's parent resource are available for export. If the field is true, then log entries from all the projects, folders, and billing accounts contained in the sink's parent resource are also available for export. Whether a particular log entry from the children is exported depends on the sink's filter expression.For example, if this field is true, then the filter resource.type=gce_instance would export all Compute Engine VM instance log entries from all projects in the sink's parent.To only export entries from certain child projects, filter on the project part of the log name:logName:(\"projects/test-project1/\" OR \"projects/test-project2/\") AND resource.type=gce_instance name=sit Output only. The client-assigned sink identifier, unique within the project.For example: \"my-syslog-errors-to-pubsub\".Sink identifiers are limited to 100 characters and can include only the following characters: upper and lower-case alphanumeric characters, underscores, hyphens, periods.First character has to be alphanumeric. output-version-format=kasd Deprecated. This field is unused. update-time=amet Output only. The last update timestamp of the sink.This field may not be present for older sinks. writer-identity=lorem Output only. An IAM identity\u2014a service account or group\u2014under which Cloud Logging writes the exported log entries to the sink's destination. This field is either set by specifying custom_writer_identity or set automatically by sinks.create and sinks.update based on the value of unique_writer_identity in those methods.Until you grant this identity write-access to the destination, log entry exports from this sink will fail. For more information, see Granting Access for a Resource (https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/granting-roles-to-service-accounts#granting_access_to_a_service_account_for_a_resource). Consult the destination service's documentation to determine the appropriate IAM roles to assign to the identity.Sinks that have a destination that is a log bucket in the same project as the sink cannot have a writer_identity and no additional permissions are required. About Cursors The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. . Each additional . moves it up one additional level. E.g. ... would go three levels up. Optional Output Flags The method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default. -o out out specifies the destination to which to write the server's result to. It will be a JSON-encoded structure. The destination may be - to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes. If unset, it defaults to standard output.

Please note that -p is followed by one or more key-value-pairs, and is called like this -p k1=v1 k2=v2 even though the listing below repeats the -p for completeness. -p custom-writer-identity=string Optional. A service account provided by the caller that will be used to write the log entries. The format must be serviceAccount:some@email. This field can only be specified if you are routing logs to a destination outside this sink's project. If not specified, a Logging service account will automatically be generated. -p unique-writer-identity=boolean Optional. See sinks.create for a description of this field. When updating a sink, the effect of this field on the value of writer_identity in the updated sink depends on both the old and new values of this field: If the old and new values of this field are both false or both true, then there is no change to the sink's writer_identity. If the old value is false and the new value is true, then writer_identity is changed to a service agent (https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-account-types#service-agents) owned by Cloud Logging. It is an error if the old value is true and the new value is set to false or defaulted to false. -p update-mask=string Optional. Field mask that specifies the fields in sink that need an update. A sink field will be overwritten if, and only if, it is in the update mask. name and output only fields cannot be updated.An empty updateMask is temporarily treated as using the following mask for backwards compatibility purposes:destination,filter,includeChildrenAt some point in the future, behavior will be removed and specifying an empty updateMask will be an error.For a detailed FieldMask definition, see https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/google.protobuf#google.protobuf.FieldMaskFor example: updateMask=filter Optional General Properties The following properties can configure any call, and are not specific to this method. -p $-xgafv=string V1 error format. -p access-token=string OAuth access token. -p alt=string Data format for response. -p callback=string JSONP -p fields=string Selector specifying which fields to include in a partial response. -p key=string API key.

Each field may be a simple scalar or another data-structure. In the latter case it is advised to set the field-cursor to the data-structure's field to specify values more concisely. For example, a structure like this: LogSink: bigquery-options: use-partitioned-tables: boolean uses-timestamp-column-partitioning: boolean create-time: string description: string destination: string disabled: boolean filter: string include-children: boolean name: string output-version-format: string update-time: string writer-identity: string can be set completely with the following arguments which are assumed to be executed in the given order. Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time. -r .bigquery-options use-partitioned-tables=false Optional. Whether to use BigQuery's partition tables (https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/partitioned-tables). By default, Cloud Logging creates dated tables based on the log entries' timestamps, e.g. syslog_20170523. With partitioned tables the date suffix is no longer present and special query syntax (https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/querying-partitioned-tables) has to be used instead. In both cases, tables are sharded based on UTC timezone. uses-timestamp-column-partitioning=false Output only. True if new timestamp column based partitioning is in use, false if legacy ingress-time partitioning is in use.All new sinks will have this field set true and will use timestamp column based partitioning. If use_partitioned_tables is false, this value has no meaning and will be false. Legacy sinks using partitioned tables will have this field set to false. .. create-time=nonumy Output only. The creation timestamp of the sink.This field may not be present for older sinks. description=sea Optional. A description of this sink.The maximum length of the description is 8000 characters. destination=ipsum Required. The export destination: \"storage.googleapis.com/[GCS_BUCKET]\" \"bigquery.googleapis.com/projects/[PROJECT_ID]/datasets/[DATASET]\" \"pubsub.googleapis.com/projects/[PROJECT_ID]/topics/[TOPIC_ID]\" \"logging.googleapis.com/projects/[PROJECT_ID]\" \"logging.googleapis.com/projects/[PROJECT_ID]/locations/[LOCATION_ID]/buckets/[BUCKET_ID]\" The sink's writer_identity, set when the sink is created, must have permission to write to the destination or else the log entries are not exported. For more information, see Exporting Logs with Sinks (https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/api/tasks/exporting-logs). disabled=true Optional. If set to true, then this sink is disabled and it does not export any log entries. filter=justo Optional. An advanced logs filter (https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/view/advanced-queries). The only exported log entries are those that are in the resource owning the sink and that match the filter.For example:logName=\"projects/[PROJECT_ID]/logs/[LOG_ID]\" AND severity>=ERROR include-children=false Optional. This field applies only to sinks owned by organizations and folders. If the field is false, the default, only the logs owned by the sink's parent resource are available for export. If the field is true, then log entries from all the projects, folders, and billing accounts contained in the sink's parent resource are also available for export. Whether a particular log entry from the children is exported depends on the sink's filter expression.For example, if this field is true, then the filter resource.type=gce_instance would export all Compute Engine VM instance log entries from all projects in the sink's parent.To only export entries from certain child projects, filter on the project part of the log name:logName:(\"projects/test-project1/\" OR \"projects/test-project2/\") AND resource.type=gce_instance name=erat Output only. The client-assigned sink identifier, unique within the project.For example: \"my-syslog-errors-to-pubsub\".Sink identifiers are limited to 100 characters and can include only the following characters: upper and lower-case alphanumeric characters, underscores, hyphens, periods.First character has to be alphanumeric. output-version-format=clita Deprecated. This field is unused. update-time=vero Output only. The last update timestamp of the sink.This field may not be present for older sinks. writer-identity=invidunt Output only. An IAM identity\u2014a service account or group\u2014under which Cloud Logging writes the exported log entries to the sink's destination. This field is either set by specifying custom_writer_identity or set automatically by sinks.create and sinks.update based on the value of unique_writer_identity in those methods.Until you grant this identity write-access to the destination, log entry exports from this sink will fail. For more information, see Granting Access for a Resource (https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/granting-roles-to-service-accounts#granting_access_to_a_service_account_for_a_resource). Consult the destination service's documentation to determine the appropriate IAM roles to assign to the identity.Sinks that have a destination that is a log bucket in the same project as the sink cannot have a writer_identity and no additional permissions are required. About Cursors The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. . Each additional . moves it up one additional level. E.g. ... would go three levels up. Optional Output Flags The method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default. -o out out specifies the destination to which to write the server's result to. It will be a JSON-encoded structure. The destination may be - to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes. If unset, it defaults to standard output. Optional Method Properties You may set the following properties to further configure the call. Please note that -p is followed by one or more key-value-pairs, and is called like this -p k1=v1 k2=v2 even though the listing below repeats the -p for completeness. -p custom-writer-identity=string Optional. A service account provided by the caller that will be used to write the log entries. The format must be serviceAccount:some@email. This field can only be specified if you are routing logs to a destination outside this sink's project. If not specified, a Logging service account will automatically be generated. -p unique-writer-identity=boolean Optional. See sinks.create for a description of this field.

The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. . Each additional . moves it up one additional level. E.g. ... would go three levels up.

Each field may be a simple scalar or another data-structure. In the latter case it is advised to set the field-cursor to the data-structure's field to specify values more concisely. For example, a structure like this: SavedQuery: create-time: string description: string display-name: string logging-query: filter: string summary-field-end: integer summary-field-start: integer name: string ops-analytics-query: sql-query-text: string update-time: string visibility: string can be set completely with the following arguments which are assumed to be executed in the given order. Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time. -r . create-time=rebum. Output only. The timestamp when the saved query was created. description=eirmod Optional. A human readable description of the saved query. display-name=dolores Optional. The user specified title for the SavedQuery. logging-query filter=aliquyam Required. An advanced query using the Logging Query Language (https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/view/logging-query-language). The maximum length of the filter is 20000 characters. summary-field-end=93 Characters will be counted from the end of the string. summary-field-start=13 Characters will be counted from the start of the string. .. name=dolor Output only. Resource name of the saved query.In the format: \"projects/[PROJECT_ID]/locations/[LOCATION_ID]/savedQueries/[QUERY_ID]\" For a list of supported locations, see Supported Regions (https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/region-support#bucket-regions)After the saved query is created, the location cannot be changed.If the user doesn't provide a QUERY_ID, the system will generate an alphanumeric ID. ops-analytics-query sql-query-text=eos Required. A logs analytics SQL query, which generally follows BigQuery format.This is the SQL query that appears in the Log Analytics UI's query editor. .. update-time=magna Output only. The timestamp when the saved query was last updated. visibility=no Required. The visibility status of this query, which determines its ownership. About Cursors The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. . Each additional . moves it up one additional level. E.g. ... would go three levels up. Optional Output Flags The method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default. -o out out specifies the destination to which to write the server's result to. It will be a JSON-encoded structure. The destination may be - to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes. If unset, it defaults to standard output. Optional Method Properties You may set the following properties to further configure the call. Please note that -p is followed by one or more key-value-pairs, and is called like this -p k1=v1 k2=v2 even though the listing below repeats the -p for completeness. -p saved-query-id=string Optional. The ID to use for the saved query, which will become the final component of the saved query's resource name.If the saved_query_id is not provided, the system will generate an alphanumeric ID.The saved_query_id is limited to 100 characters and can include only the following characters: upper and lower-case alphanumeric characters, underscores, hyphens, periods.First character has to be alphanumeric.

Each field may be a simple scalar or another data-structure. In the latter case it is advised to set the field-cursor to the data-structure's field to specify values more concisely. For example, a structure like this: LogSink: bigquery-options: use-partitioned-tables: boolean uses-timestamp-column-partitioning: boolean create-time: string description: string destination: string disabled: boolean filter: string include-children: boolean name: string output-version-format: string update-time: string writer-identity: string can be set completely with the following arguments which are assumed to be executed in the given order. Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time. -r .bigquery-options use-partitioned-tables=false Optional. Whether to use BigQuery's partition tables (https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/partitioned-tables). By default, Cloud Logging creates dated tables based on the log entries' timestamps, e.g. syslog_20170523. With partitioned tables the date suffix is no longer present and special query syntax (https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/querying-partitioned-tables) has to be used instead. In both cases, tables are sharded based on UTC timezone. uses-timestamp-column-partitioning=false Output only. True if new timestamp column based partitioning is in use, false if legacy ingress-time partitioning is in use.All new sinks will have this field set true and will use timestamp column based partitioning. If use_partitioned_tables is false, this value has no meaning and will be false. Legacy sinks using partitioned tables will have this field set to false. .. create-time=consetetur Output only. The creation timestamp of the sink.This field may not be present for older sinks. description=ea Optional. A description of this sink.The maximum length of the description is 8000 characters. destination=lorem Required. The export destination: \"storage.googleapis.com/[GCS_BUCKET]\" \"bigquery.googleapis.com/projects/[PROJECT_ID]/datasets/[DATASET]\" \"pubsub.googleapis.com/projects/[PROJECT_ID]/topics/[TOPIC_ID]\" \"logging.googleapis.com/projects/[PROJECT_ID]\" \"logging.googleapis.com/projects/[PROJECT_ID]/locations/[LOCATION_ID]/buckets/[BUCKET_ID]\" The sink's writer_identity, set when the sink is created, must have permission to write to the destination or else the log entries are not exported. For more information, see Exporting Logs with Sinks (https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/api/tasks/exporting-logs). disabled=false Optional. If set to true, then this sink is disabled and it does not export any log entries. filter=justo Optional. An advanced logs filter (https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/view/advanced-queries). The only exported log entries are those that are in the resource owning the sink and that match the filter.For example:logName=\"projects/[PROJECT_ID]/logs/[LOG_ID]\" AND severity>=ERROR include-children=true Optional. This field applies only to sinks owned by organizations and folders. If the field is false, the default, only the logs owned by the sink's parent resource are available for export. If the field is true, then log entries from all the projects, folders, and billing accounts contained in the sink's parent resource are also available for export. Whether a particular log entry from the children is exported depends on the sink's filter expression.For example, if this field is true, then the filter resource.type=gce_instance would export all Compute Engine VM instance log entries from all projects in the sink's parent.To only export entries from certain child projects, filter on the project part of the log name:logName:(\"projects/test-project1/\" OR \"projects/test-project2/\") AND resource.type=gce_instance name=labore Output only. The client-assigned sink identifier, unique within the project.For example: \"my-syslog-errors-to-pubsub\".Sink identifiers are limited to 100 characters and can include only the following characters: upper and lower-case alphanumeric characters, underscores, hyphens, periods.First character has to be alphanumeric. output-version-format=gubergren Deprecated. This field is unused. update-time=vero Output only. The last update timestamp of the sink.This field may not be present for older sinks. writer-identity=ea Output only. An IAM identity\u2014a service account or group\u2014under which Cloud Logging writes the exported log entries to the sink's destination. This field is either set by specifying custom_writer_identity or set automatically by sinks.create and sinks.update based on the value of unique_writer_identity in those methods.Until you grant this identity write-access to the destination, log entry exports from this sink will fail. For more information, see Granting Access for a Resource (https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/granting-roles-to-service-accounts#granting_access_to_a_service_account_for_a_resource). Consult the destination service's documentation to determine the appropriate IAM roles to assign to the identity.Sinks that have a destination that is a log bucket in the same project as the sink cannot have a writer_identity and no additional permissions are required. About Cursors The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. . Each additional . moves it up one additional level. E.g. ... would go three levels up. Optional Output Flags The method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default. -o out out specifies the destination to which to write the server's result to. It will be a JSON-encoded structure. The destination may be - to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes. If unset, it defaults to standard output. Optional Method Properties You may set the following properties to further configure the call. Please note that -p is followed by one or more key-value-pairs, and is called like this -p k1=v1 k2=v2 even though the listing below repeats the -p for completeness. -p custom-writer-identity=string Optional. A service account provided by the caller that will be used to write the log entries. The format must be serviceAccount:some@email. This field can only be specified if you are routing logs to a destination outside this sink's project. If not specified, a Logging service account will automatically be generated. -p unique-writer-identity=boolean Optional. Determines the kind of IAM identity returned as writer_identity in the new sink. If this value is omitted or set to false, and if the sink's parent is a project, then the value returned as writer_identity is the same group or service account used by Cloud Logging before the addition of writer identities to this API. The sink's destination must be in the same project as the sink itself.If this field is set to true, or if the sink is owned by a non-project resource such as an organization, then the value of writer_identity will be a service agent (https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-account-types#service-agents) used by the sinks with the same parent.

You can set the scope for this method like this: logging2 --scope <scope> organizations sinks-patch ... Required Scalar Argument <sink-name> (string) Required.

Each field may be a simple scalar or another data-structure. In the latter case it is advised to set the field-cursor to the data-structure's field to specify values more concisely. For example, a structure like this: LogSink: bigquery-options: use-partitioned-tables: boolean uses-timestamp-column-partitioning: boolean create-time: string description: string destination: string disabled: boolean filter: string include-children: boolean name: string output-version-format: string update-time: string writer-identity: string can be set completely with the following arguments which are assumed to be executed in the given order. Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time. -r .bigquery-options use-partitioned-tables=false Optional. Whether to use BigQuery's partition tables (https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/partitioned-tables). By default, Cloud Logging creates dated tables based on the log entries' timestamps, e.g. syslog_20170523. With partitioned tables the date suffix is no longer present and special query syntax (https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/querying-partitioned-tables) has to be used instead. In both cases, tables are sharded based on UTC timezone. uses-timestamp-column-partitioning=true Output only. True if new timestamp column based partitioning is in use, false if legacy ingress-time partitioning is in use.All new sinks will have this field set true and will use timestamp column based partitioning. If use_partitioned_tables is false, this value has no meaning and will be false. Legacy sinks using partitioned tables will have this field set to false. .. create-time=et Output only. The creation timestamp of the sink.This field may not be present for older sinks. description=dolore Optional. A description of this sink.The maximum length of the description is 8000 characters. destination=voluptua. Required. The export destination: \"storage.googleapis.com/[GCS_BUCKET]\" \"bigquery.googleapis.com/projects/[PROJECT_ID]/datasets/[DATASET]\" \"pubsub.googleapis.com/projects/[PROJECT_ID]/topics/[TOPIC_ID]\" \"logging.googleapis.com/projects/[PROJECT_ID]\" \"logging.googleapis.com/projects/[PROJECT_ID]/locations/[LOCATION_ID]/buckets/[BUCKET_ID]\" The sink's writer_identity, set when the sink is created, must have permission to write to the destination or else the log entries are not exported. For more information, see Exporting Logs with Sinks (https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/api/tasks/exporting-logs). disabled=true Optional. If set to true, then this sink is disabled and it does not export any log entries. filter=sanctus Optional. An advanced logs filter (https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/view/advanced-queries). The only exported log entries are those that are in the resource owning the sink and that match the filter.For example:logName=\"projects/[PROJECT_ID]/logs/[LOG_ID]\" AND severity>=ERROR include-children=true Optional. This field applies only to sinks owned by organizations and folders. If the field is false, the default, only the logs owned by the sink's parent resource are available for export. If the field is true, then log entries from all the projects, folders, and billing accounts contained in the sink's parent resource are also available for export. Whether a particular log entry from the children is exported depends on the sink's filter expression.For example, if this field is true, then the filter resource.type=gce_instance would export all Compute Engine VM instance log entries from all projects in the sink's parent.To only export entries from certain child projects, filter on the project part of the log name:logName:(\"projects/test-project1/\" OR \"projects/test-project2/\") AND resource.type=gce_instance name=eirmod Output only. The client-assigned sink identifier, unique within the project.For example: \"my-syslog-errors-to-pubsub\".Sink identifiers are limited to 100 characters and can include only the following characters: upper and lower-case alphanumeric characters, underscores, hyphens, periods.First character has to be alphanumeric. output-version-format=vero Deprecated. This field is unused. update-time=voluptua. Output only. The last update timestamp of the sink.This field may not be present for older sinks. writer-identity=sea Output only. An IAM identity\u2014a service account or group\u2014under which Cloud Logging writes the exported log entries to the sink's destination. This field is either set by specifying custom_writer_identity or set automatically by sinks.create and sinks.update based on the value of unique_writer_identity in those methods.Until you grant this identity write-access to the destination, log entry exports from this sink will fail. For more information, see Granting Access for a Resource (https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/granting-roles-to-service-accounts#granting_access_to_a_service_account_for_a_resource). Consult the destination service's documentation to determine the appropriate IAM roles to assign to the identity.Sinks that have a destination that is a log bucket in the same project as the sink cannot have a writer_identity and no additional permissions are required. About Cursors The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. . Each additional . moves it up one additional level. E.g. ... would go three levels up. Optional Output Flags The method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default. -o out out specifies the destination to which to write the server's result to. It will be a JSON-encoded structure. The destination may be - to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes. If unset, it defaults to standard output. Optional Method Properties You may set the following properties to further configure the call. Please note that -p is followed by one or more key-value-pairs, and is called like this -p k1=v1 k2=v2 even though the listing below repeats the -p for completeness. -p custom-writer-identity=string Optional. A service account provided by the caller that will be used to write the log entries. The format must be serviceAccount:some@email. This field can only be specified if you are routing logs to a destination outside this sink's project. If not specified, a Logging service account will automatically be generated. -p unique-writer-identity=boolean Optional. See sinks.create for a description of this field. When updating a sink, the effect of this field on the value of writer_identity in the updated sink depends on both the old and new values of this field: If the old and new values of this field are both false or both true, then there is no change to the sink's writer_identity. If the old value is false and the new value is true, then writer_identity is changed to a service agent (https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-account-types#service-agents) owned by Cloud Logging. It is an error if the old value is true and the new value is set to false or defaulted to false. -p update-mask=string Optional. Field mask that specifies the fields in sink that need an update. A sink field will be overwritten if, and only if, it is in the update mask. name and output only fields cannot be updated.An empty updateMask is temporarily treated as using the following mask for backwards compatibility purposes:destination,filter,includeChildrenAt some point in the future, behavior will be removed and specifying an empty updateMask will be an error.For a detailed FieldMask definition, see https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/google.protobuf#google.protobuf.FieldMaskFor example: updateMask=filter Optional General Properties The following properties can configure any call, and are not specific to this method. -p $-xgafv=string V1 error format. -p access-token=string OAuth access token. -p alt=string Data format for response. -p callback=string JSONP -p fields=string Selector specifying which fields to include in a partial response. -p key=string API key.

For more information, see Granting Access for a Resource (https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/granting-roles-to-service-accounts#granting_access_to_a_service_account_for_a_resource). Consult the destination service's documentation to determine the appropriate IAM roles to assign to the identity.Sinks that have a destination that is a log bucket in the same project as the sink cannot have a writer_identity and no additional permissions are required. About Cursors The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. . Each additional . moves it up one additional level. E.g. ... would go three levels up. Optional Output Flags The method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default. -o out out specifies the destination to which to write the server's result to. It will be a JSON-encoded structure. The destination may be - to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes. If unset, it defaults to standard output. Optional Method Properties You may set the following properties to further configure the call. Please note that -p is followed by one or more key-value-pairs, and is called like this -p k1=v1 k2=v2 even though the listing below repeats the -p for completeness. -p custom-writer-identity=string Optional. A service account provided by the caller that will be used to write the log entries. The format must be serviceAccount:some@email. This field can only be specified if you are routing logs to a destination outside this sink's project. If not specified, a Logging service account will automatically be generated. -p unique-writer-identity=boolean Optional. See sinks.create for a description of this field. When updating a sink, the effect of this field on the value of writer_identity in the updated sink depends on both the old and new values of this field: If the old and new values of this field are both false or both true, then there is no change to the sink's writer_identity. If the old value is false and the new value is true, then writer_identity is changed to a service agent (https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-account-types#service-agents) owned by Cloud Logging. It is an error if the old value is true and the new value is set to false or defaulted to false. -p update-mask=string Optional. Field mask that specifies the fields in sink that need an update. A sink field will be overwritten if, and only if, it is in the update mask. name and output only fields cannot be updated.An empty updateMask is temporarily treated as using the following mask for backwards compatibility purposes:destination,filter,includeChildrenAt some point in the future, behavior will be removed and specifying an empty updateMask will be an error.For a detailed FieldMask definition, see https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/google.protobuf#google.protobuf.FieldMaskFor example: updateMask=filter Optional General Properties The following properties can configure any call, and are not specific to this method. -p $-xgafv=string V1 error format. -p access-token=string OAuth access token. -p alt=string Data format for response. -p callback=string JSONP -p fields=string Selector specifying which fields to include in a partial response. -p key=string API key.

About Cursors The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. . Each additional . moves it up one additional level. E.g. ... would go three levels up. Optional Output Flags The method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default. -o out out specifies the destination to which to write the server's result to. It will be a JSON-encoded structure. The destination may be - to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes. If unset, it defaults to standard output.

For example, a structure like this: LogMetric: bucket-name: string bucket-options: explicit-buckets: bounds: [number] exponential-buckets: growth-factor: number num-finite-buckets: integer scale: number linear-buckets: num-finite-buckets: integer offset: number width: number create-time: string description: string disabled: boolean filter: string label-extractors: { string: string } metric-descriptor: description: string display-name: string launch-stage: string metadata: ingest-delay: string launch-stage: string sample-period: string metric-kind: string monitored-resource-types: [string] name: string type: string unit: string value-type: string name: string update-time: string value-extractor: string version: string can be set completely with the following arguments which are assumed to be executed in the given order. Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time. -r . bucket-name=justo Optional. The resource name of the Log Bucket that owns the Log Metric. Only Log Buckets in projects are supported. The bucket has to be in the same project as the metric.For example:projects/my-project/locations/global/buckets/my-bucketIf empty, then the Log Metric is considered a non-Bucket Log Metric. bucket-options.explicit-buckets bounds=0.773923599371628 The values must be monotonically increasing. Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. ..exponential-buckets growth-factor=0.23156124875189255 Must be greater than 1. num-finite-buckets=8 Must be greater than 0. scale=0.7083869727497976 Must be greater than 0. ..linear-buckets num-finite-buckets=94 Must be greater than 0. offset=0.9952561329790817 Lower bound of the first bucket. width=0.9998439256505336 Must be greater than 0. ... create-time=et Output only. The creation timestamp of the metric.This field may not be present for older metrics. description=consetetur Optional. A description of this metric, which is used in documentation. The maximum length of the description is 8000 characters. disabled=false Optional. If set to True, then this metric is disabled and it does not generate any points. filter=voluptua. Required. An advanced logs filter (https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/view/advanced_filters) which is used to match log entries. Example: \"resource.type=gae_app AND severity>=ERROR\" The maximum length of the filter is 20000 characters. label-extractors=key=kasd Optional. A map from a label key string to an extractor expression which is used to extract data from a log entry field and assign as the label value. Each label key specified in the LabelDescriptor must have an associated extractor expression in this map. The syntax of the extractor expression is the same as for the value_extractor field.The extracted value is converted to the type defined in the label descriptor. If either the extraction or the type conversion fails, the label will have a default value. The default value for a string label is an empty string, for an integer label its 0, and for a boolean label its false.Note that there are upper bounds on the maximum number of labels and the number of active time series that are allowed in a project. the value will be associated with the given key metric-descriptor description=no A detailed description of the metric, which can be used in documentation. display-name=amet. A concise name for the metric, which can be displayed in user interfaces. Use sentence case without an ending period, for example \"Request count\". This field is optional but it is recommended to be set for any metrics associated with user-visible concepts, such as Quota. launch-stage=aliquyam Optional. The launch stage of the metric definition. metadata ingest-delay=accusam The delay of data points caused by ingestion. Data points older than this age are guaranteed to be ingested and available to be read, excluding data loss due to errors. launch-stage=sanctus Deprecated. Must use the MetricDescriptor.launch_stage instead. sample-period=duo The sampling period of metric data points. For metrics which are written periodically, consecutive data points are stored at this time interval, excluding data loss due to errors. Metrics with a higher granularity have a smaller sampling period. .. metric-kind=kasd Whether the metric records instantaneous values, changes to a value, etc. Some combinations of metric_kind and value_type might not be supported. monitored-resource-types=eos Read-only. If present, then a time series, which is identified partially by a metric type and a MonitoredResourceDescriptor, that is associated with this metric type can only be associated with one of the monitored resource types listed here. Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. name=no The resource name of the metric descriptor. type=kasd The metric type, including its DNS name prefix. The type is not URL-encoded. All user-defined metric types have the DNS name custom.googleapis.com or external.googleapis.com. Metric types should use a natural hierarchical grouping. For example: \"custom.googleapis.com/invoice/paid/amount\" \"external.googleapis.com/prometheus/up\" \"appengine.googleapis.com/http/server/response_latencies\" unit=sanctus The units in which the metric value is reported. It is only applicable if the value_type is INT64, DOUBLE, or DISTRIBUTION. The unit defines the representation of the stored metric values.Different systems might scale the values to be more easily displayed (so a value of 0.02kBy might be displayed as 20By, and a value of 3523kBy might be displayed as 3.5MBy). However, if the unit is kBy, then the value of the metric is always in thousands of bytes, no matter how it might be displayed.If you want a custom metric to record the exact number of CPU-seconds used by a job, you can create an INT64 CUMULATIVE metric whose unit is s{CPU} (or equivalently 1s{CPU} or just s). If the job uses 12,005 CPU-seconds, then the value is written as 12005.Alternatively, if you want a custom metric to record data in a more granular way, you can create a DOUBLE CUMULATIVE metric whose unit is ks{CPU}, and then write the value 12.005 (which is 12005/1000), or use Kis{CPU} and write 11.723 (which is 12005/1024).The supported units are a subset of The Unified Code for Units of Measure (https://unitsofmeasure.org/ucum.html) standard:Basic units (UNIT) bit bit By byte s second min minute h hour d day 1 dimensionlessPrefixes (PREFIX) k kilo (10^3) M mega (10^6) G giga (10^9) T tera (10^12) P peta (10^15) E exa (10^18) Z zetta (10^21) Y yotta (10^24) m milli (10^-3) u micro (10^-6) n nano (10^-9) p pico (10^-12) f femto (10^-15) a atto (10^-18) z zepto (10^-21) y yocto (10^-24) Ki kibi (2^10) Mi mebi (2^20) Gi gibi (2^30) Ti tebi (2^40) Pi pebi (2^50)GrammarThe grammar also includes these connectors: / division or ratio (as an infix operator). For examples, kBy/{email} or MiBy/10ms (although you should almost never have /s in a metric unit; rates should always be computed at query time from the underlying cumulative or delta value). . multiplication or composition (as an infix operator). For examples, GBy.d or k{watt}.h.The grammar for a unit is as follows: Expression = Component { \".\" Component } { \"/\" Component } ; Component = ( [ PREFIX ] UNIT | \"%\" ) [ Annotation ] | Annotation | \"1\" ; Annotation = \"{\" NAME \"}\" ; Notes: Annotation is just a comment if it follows a UNIT. If the annotation is used alone, then the unit is equivalent to 1. For examples, {request}/s == 1/s, By{transmitted}/s == By/s. NAME is a sequence of non-blank printable ASCII characters not containing { or }. 1 represents a unitary dimensionless unit (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensionless_quantity) of 1, such as in 1/s. It is typically used when none of the basic units are appropriate. For example, \"new users per day\" can be represented as 1/d or {new-users}/d (and a metric value 5 would mean \"5 new users). Alternatively, \"thousands of page views per day\" would be represented as 1000/d or k1/d or k{page_views}/d (and a metric value of 5.3 would mean \"5300 page views per day\"). % represents dimensionless value of 1/100, and annotates values giving a percentage (so the metric values are typically in the range of 0..100, and a metric value 3 means \"3 percent\"). 10^2.% indicates a metric contains a ratio, typically in the range 0..1, that will be multiplied by 100 and displayed as a percentage (so a metric value 0.03 means \"3 percent\"). value-type=gubergren Whether the measurement is an integer, a floating-point number, etc. Some combinations of metric_kind and value_type might not be supported. .. name=accusam Required. The client-assigned metric identifier. Examples: \"error_count\", \"nginx/requests\".Metric identifiers are limited to 100 characters and can include only the following characters: A-Z, a-z, 0-9, and the special characters _-.,+!*',()%/. The forward-slash character (/) denotes a hierarchy of name pieces, and it cannot be the first character of the name.This field is the [METRIC_ID] part of a metric resource name in the format \"projects/PROJECT_ID/metrics/METRIC_ID\". Example: If the resource name of a metric is \"projects/my-project/metrics/nginx%2Frequests\", this field's value is \"nginx/requests\". update-time=lorem Output only. The last update timestamp of the metric.This field may not be present for older metrics. value-extractor=dolor Optional. A value_extractor is required when using a distribution logs-based metric to extract the values to record from a log entry. Two functions are supported for value extraction: EXTRACT(field) or REGEXP_EXTRACT(field, regex). The arguments are: field: The name of the log entry field from which the value is to be extracted. regex: A regular expression using the Google RE2 syntax (https://github.com/google/re2/wiki/Syntax) with a single capture group to extract data from the specified log entry field. The value of the field is converted to a string before applying the regex. It is an error to specify a regex that does not include exactly one capture group.The result of the extraction must be convertible to a double type, as the distribution always records double values. If either the extraction or the conversion to double fails, then those values are not recorded in the distribution.Example: REGEXP_EXTRACT(jsonPayload.request, \". quantity=(\\d+). \") version=sanctus Deprecated. The API version that created or updated this metric. The v2 format is used by default and cannot be changed. About Cursors The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. . Each additional . moves it up one additional level. E.g. ... would go three levels up. Optional Output Flags The method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default. -o out out specifies the destination to which to write the server's result to. It will be a JSON-encoded structure. The destination may be - to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes. If unset, it defaults to standard output. Optional General Properties The following properties can configure any call, and are not specific to this method. -p $-xgafv=string V1 error format. -p access-token=string OAuth access token. -p alt=string Data format for response. -p callback=string JSONP -p fields=string Selector specifying which fields to include in a partial response. -p key=string API key.

In the latter case it is advised to set the field-cursor to the data-structure's field to specify values more concisely. For example, a structure like this: LogMetric: bucket-name: string bucket-options: explicit-buckets: bounds: [number] exponential-buckets: growth-factor: number num-finite-buckets: integer scale: number linear-buckets: num-finite-buckets: integer offset: number width: number create-time: string description: string disabled: boolean filter: string label-extractors: { string: string } metric-descriptor: description: string display-name: string launch-stage: string metadata: ingest-delay: string launch-stage: string sample-period: string metric-kind: string monitored-resource-types: [string] name: string type: string unit: string value-type: string name: string update-time: string value-extractor: string version: string can be set completely with the following arguments which are assumed to be executed in the given order. Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time. -r . bucket-name=sea Optional. The resource name of the Log Bucket that owns the Log Metric. Only Log Buckets in projects are supported. The bucket has to be in the same project as the metric.For example:projects/my-project/locations/global/buckets/my-bucketIf empty, then the Log Metric is considered a non-Bucket Log Metric. bucket-options.explicit-buckets bounds=0.1790485980487856 The values must be monotonically increasing.

The creation timestamp of the metric.This field may not be present for older metrics. description=duo Optional. A description of this metric, which is used in documentation. The maximum length of the description is 8000 characters. disabled=false Optional. If set to True, then this metric is disabled and it does not generate any points. filter=et Required. An advanced logs filter (https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/view/advanced_filters) which is used to match log entries. Example: \"resource.type=gae_app AND severity>=ERROR\" The maximum length of the filter is 20000 characters. label-extractors=key=lorem Optional. A map from a label key string to an extractor expression which is used to extract data from a log entry field and assign as the label value. Each label key specified in the LabelDescriptor must have an associated extractor expression in this map. The syntax of the extractor expression is the same as for the value_extractor field.The extracted value is converted to the type defined in the label descriptor. If either the extraction or the type conversion fails, the label will have a default value. The default value for a string label is an empty string, for an integer label its 0, and for a boolean label its false.Note that there are upper bounds on the maximum number of labels and the number of active time series that are allowed in a project. the value will be associated with the given key metric-descriptor description=no A detailed description of the metric, which can be used in documentation. display-name=sea A concise name for the metric, which can be displayed in user interfaces. Use sentence case without an ending period, for example \"Request count\". This field is optional but it is recommended to be set for any metrics associated with user-visible concepts, such as Quota. launch-stage=et Optional. The launch stage of the metric definition. metadata ingest-delay=voluptua. The delay of data points caused by ingestion. Data points older than this age are guaranteed to be ingested and available to be read, excluding data loss due to errors. launch-stage=ipsum Deprecated. Must use the MetricDescriptor.launch_stage instead. sample-period=ea The sampling period of metric data points. For metrics which are written periodically, consecutive data points are stored at this time interval, excluding data loss due to errors. Metrics with a higher granularity have a smaller sampling period. .. metric-kind=ipsum Whether the metric records instantaneous values, changes to a value, etc. Some combinations of metric_kind and value_type might not be supported. monitored-resource-types=eos Read-only. If present, then a time series, which is identified partially by a metric type and a MonitoredResourceDescriptor, that is associated with this metric type can only be associated with one of the monitored resource types listed here. Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. name=vero The resource name of the metric descriptor. type=sanctus The metric type, including its DNS name prefix. The type is not URL-encoded. All user-defined metric types have the DNS name custom.googleapis.com or external.googleapis.com. Metric types should use a natural hierarchical grouping. For example: \"custom.googleapis.com/invoice/paid/amount\" \"external.googleapis.com/prometheus/up\" \"appengine.googleapis.com/http/server/response_latencies\" unit=dolores The units in which the metric value is reported. It is only applicable if the value_type is INT64, DOUBLE, or DISTRIBUTION. The unit defines the representation of the stored metric values.Different systems might scale the values to be more easily displayed (so a value of 0.02kBy might be displayed as 20By, and a value of 3523kBy might be displayed as 3.5MBy). However, if the unit is kBy, then the value of the metric is always in thousands of bytes, no matter how it might be displayed.If you want a custom metric to record the exact number of CPU-seconds used by a job, you can create an INT64 CUMULATIVE metric whose unit is s{CPU} (or equivalently 1s{CPU} or just s). If the job uses 12,005 CPU-seconds, then the value is written as 12005.Alternatively, if you want a custom metric to record data in a more granular way, you can create a DOUBLE CUMULATIVE metric whose unit is ks{CPU}, and then write the value 12.005 (which is 12005/1000), or use Kis{CPU} and write 11.723 (which is 12005/1024).The supported units are a subset of The Unified Code for Units of Measure (https://unitsofmeasure.org/ucum.html) standard:Basic units (UNIT) bit bit By byte s second min minute h hour d day 1 dimensionlessPrefixes (PREFIX) k kilo (10^3) M mega (10^6) G giga (10^9) T tera (10^12) P peta (10^15) E exa (10^18) Z zetta (10^21) Y yotta (10^24) m milli (10^-3) u micro (10^-6) n nano (10^-9) p pico (10^-12) f femto (10^-15) a atto (10^-18) z zepto (10^-21) y yocto (10^-24) Ki kibi (2^10) Mi mebi (2^20) Gi gibi (2^30) Ti tebi (2^40) Pi pebi (2^50)GrammarThe grammar also includes these connectors: / division or ratio (as an infix operator). For examples, kBy/{email} or MiBy/10ms (although you should almost never have /s in a metric unit; rates should always be computed at query time from the underlying cumulative or delta value). . multiplication or composition (as an infix operator). For examples, GBy.d or k{watt}.h.The grammar for a unit is as follows: Expression = Component { \".\" Component } { \"/\" Component } ; Component = ( [ PREFIX ] UNIT | \"%\" ) [ Annotation ] | Annotation | \"1\" ; Annotation = \"{\" NAME \"}\" ; Notes: Annotation is just a comment if it follows a UNIT. If the annotation is used alone, then the unit is equivalent to 1. For examples, {request}/s == 1/s, By{transmitted}/s == By/s. NAME is a sequence of non-blank printable ASCII characters not containing { or }. 1 represents a unitary dimensionless unit (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensionless_quantity) of 1, such as in 1/s. It is typically used when none of the basic units are appropriate. For example, \"new users per day\" can be represented as 1/d or {new-users}/d (and a metric value 5 would mean \"5 new users). Alternatively, \"thousands of page views per day\" would be represented as 1000/d or k1/d or k{page_views}/d (and a metric value of 5.3 would mean \"5300 page views per day\"). % represents dimensionless value of 1/100, and annotates values giving a percentage (so the metric values are typically in the range of 0..100, and a metric value 3 means \"3 percent\"). 10^2.% indicates a metric contains a ratio, typically in the range 0..1, that will be multiplied by 100 and displayed as a percentage (so a metric value 0.03 means \"3 percent\"). value-type=elitr Whether the measurement is an integer, a floating-point number, etc. Some combinations of metric_kind and value_type might not be supported. .. name=diam Required. The client-assigned metric identifier. Examples: \"error_count\", \"nginx/requests\".Metric identifiers are limited to 100 characters and can include only the following characters: A-Z, a-z, 0-9, and the special characters _-.,+!*',()%/. The forward-slash character (/) denotes a hierarchy of name pieces, and it cannot be the first character of the name.This field is the [METRIC_ID] part of a metric resource name in the format \"projects/PROJECT_ID/metrics/METRIC_ID\". Example: If the resource name of a metric is \"projects/my-project/metrics/nginx%2Frequests\", this field's value is \"nginx/requests\". update-time=sed Output only. The last update timestamp of the metric.This field may not be present for older metrics. value-extractor=lorem Optional. A value_extractor is required when using a distribution logs-based metric to extract the values to record from a log entry. Two functions are supported for value extraction: EXTRACT(field) or REGEXP_EXTRACT(field, regex). The arguments are: field: The name of the log entry field from which the value is to be extracted. regex: A regular expression using the Google RE2 syntax (https://github.com/google/re2/wiki/Syntax) with a single capture group to extract data from the specified log entry field. The value of the field is converted to a string before applying the regex. It is an error to specify a regex that does not include exactly one capture group.The result of the extraction must be convertible to a double type, as the distribution always records double values. If either the extraction or the conversion to double fails, then those values are not recorded in the distribution.Example: REGEXP_EXTRACT(jsonPayload.request, \". quantity=(\\d+). \") version=magna Deprecated. The API version that created or updated this metric. The v2 format is used by default and cannot be changed. About Cursors The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. . Each additional . moves it up one additional level. E.g. ... would go three levels up. Optional Output Flags The method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default. -o out out specifies the destination to which to write the server's result to. It will be a JSON-encoded structure. The destination may be - to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes. If unset, it defaults to standard output. Optional General Properties The following properties can configure any call, and are not specific to this method. -p $-xgafv=string V1 error format. -p access-token=string OAuth access token. -p alt=string Data format for response. -p callback=string JSONP -p fields=string Selector specifying which fields to include in a partial response. -p key=string API key.

For examples, kBy/{email} or MiBy/10ms (although you should almost never have /s in a metric unit; rates should always be computed at query time from the underlying cumulative or delta value). . multiplication or composition (as an infix operator). For examples, GBy.d or k{watt}.h.The grammar for a unit is as follows: Expression = Component { \".\" Component } { \"/\" Component } ; Component = ( [ PREFIX ] UNIT | \"%\" ) [ Annotation ] | Annotation | \"1\" ; Annotation = \"{\" NAME \"}\" ; Notes: Annotation is just a comment if it follows a UNIT. If the annotation is used alone, then the unit is equivalent to 1. For examples, {request}/s == 1/s, By{transmitted}/s == By/s. NAME is a sequence of non-blank printable ASCII characters not containing { or }. 1 represents a unitary dimensionless unit (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensionless_quantity) of 1, such as in 1/s. It is typically used when none of the basic units are appropriate. For example, \"new users per day\" can be represented as 1/d or {new-users}/d (and a metric value 5 would mean \"5 new users). Alternatively, \"thousands of page views per day\" would be represented as 1000/d or k1/d or k{page_views}/d (and a metric value of 5.3 would mean \"5300 page views per day\"). % represents dimensionless value of 1/100, and annotates values giving a percentage (so the metric values are typically in the range of 0..100, and a metric value 3 means \"3 percent\"). 10^2.% indicates a metric contains a ratio, typically in the range 0..1, that will be multiplied by 100 and displayed as a percentage (so a metric value 0.03 means \"3 percent\"). value-type=elitr Whether the measurement is an integer, a floating-point number, etc. Some combinations of metric_kind and value_type might not be supported. .. name=diam Required. The client-assigned metric identifier. Examples: \"error_count\", \"nginx/requests\".Metric identifiers are limited to 100 characters and can include only the following characters: A-Z, a-z, 0-9, and the special characters _-.,+!*',()%/. The forward-slash character (/) denotes a hierarchy of name pieces, and it cannot be the first character of the name.This field is the [METRIC_ID] part of a metric resource name in the format \"projects/PROJECT_ID/metrics/METRIC_ID\". Example: If the resource name of a metric is \"projects/my-project/metrics/nginx%2Frequests\", this field's value is \"nginx/requests\". update-time=sed Output only. The last update timestamp of the metric.This field may not be present for older metrics. value-extractor=lorem Optional. A value_extractor is required when using a distribution logs-based metric to extract the values to record from a log entry. Two functions are supported for value extraction: EXTRACT(field) or REGEXP_EXTRACT(field, regex). The arguments are: field: The name of the log entry field from which the value is to be extracted. regex: A regular expression using the Google RE2 syntax (https://github.com/google/re2/wiki/Syntax) with a single capture group to extract data from the specified log entry field. The value of the field is converted to a string before applying the regex. It is an error to specify a regex that does not include exactly one capture group.The result of the extraction must be convertible to a double type, as the distribution always records double values. If either the extraction or the conversion to double fails, then those values are not recorded in the distribution.Example: REGEXP_EXTRACT(jsonPayload.request, \". quantity=(\\d+). \") version=magna Deprecated. The API version that created or updated this metric.

Each field may be a simple scalar or another data-structure. In the latter case it is advised to set the field-cursor to the data-structure's field to specify values more concisely. For example, a structure like this: LogSink: bigquery-options: use-partitioned-tables: boolean uses-timestamp-column-partitioning: boolean create-time: string description: string destination: string disabled: boolean filter: string include-children: boolean name: string output-version-format: string update-time: string writer-identity: string can be set completely with the following arguments which are assumed to be executed in the given order. Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time. -r .bigquery-options use-partitioned-tables=true Optional. Whether to use BigQuery's partition tables (https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/partitioned-tables). By default, Cloud Logging creates dated tables based on the log entries' timestamps, e.g. syslog_20170523.

For more information, see Exporting Logs with Sinks (https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/api/tasks/exporting-logs). disabled=true Optional. If set to true, then this sink is disabled and it does not export any log entries. filter=diam Optional. An advanced logs filter (https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/view/advanced-queries). The only exported log entries are those that are in the resource owning the sink and that match the filter.For example:logName=\"projects/[PROJECT_ID]/logs/[LOG_ID]\" AND severity>=ERROR include-children=false Optional. This field applies only to sinks owned by organizations and folders. If the field is false, the default, only the logs owned by the sink's parent resource are available for export. If the field is true, then log entries from all the projects, folders, and billing accounts contained in the sink's parent resource are also available for export. Whether a particular log entry from the children is exported depends on the sink's filter expression.For example, if this field is true, then the filter resource.type=gce_instance would export all Compute Engine VM instance log entries from all projects in the sink's parent.To only export entries from certain child projects, filter on the project part of the log name:logName:(\"projects/test-project1/\" OR \"projects/test-project2/\") AND resource.type=gce_instance name=dolore Output only.

An IAM identity\u2014a service account or group\u2014under which Cloud Logging writes the exported log entries to the sink's destination. This field is either set by specifying custom_writer_identity or set automatically by sinks.create and sinks.update based on the value of unique_writer_identity in those methods.Until you grant this identity write-access to the destination, log entry exports from this sink will fail. For more information, see Granting Access for a Resource (https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/granting-roles-to-service-accounts#granting_access_to_a_service_account_for_a_resource). Consult the destination service's documentation to determine the appropriate IAM roles to assign to the identity.Sinks that have a destination that is a log bucket in the same project as the sink cannot have a writer_identity and no additional permissions are required. About Cursors The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly.

Optional Method Properties You may set the following properties to further configure the call. Please note that -p is followed by one or more key-value-pairs, and is called like this -p k1=v1 k2=v2 even though the listing below repeats the -p for completeness. -p custom-writer-identity=string Optional. A service account provided by the caller that will be used to write the log entries. The format must be serviceAccount:some@email. This field can only be specified if you are routing logs to a destination outside this sink's project. If not specified, a Logging service account will automatically be generated. -p unique-writer-identity=boolean Optional. Determines the kind of IAM identity returned as writer_identity in the new sink. If this value is omitted or set to false, and if the sink's parent is a project, then the value returned as writer_identity is the same group or service account used by Cloud Logging before the addition of writer identities to this API. The sink's destination must be in the same project as the sink itself.If this field is set to true, or if the sink is owned by a non-project resource such as an organization, then the value of writer_identity will be a service agent (https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-account-types#service-agents) used by the sinks with the same parent.

You can set the scope for this method like this: logging2 --scope <scope> projects sinks-patch ... Required Scalar Argument <sink-name> (string) Required.

Each field may be a simple scalar or another data-structure. In the latter case it is advised to set the field-cursor to the data-structure's field to specify values more concisely. For example, a structure like this: LogSink: bigquery-options: use-partitioned-tables: boolean uses-timestamp-column-partitioning: boolean create-time: string description: string destination: string disabled: boolean filter: string include-children: boolean name: string output-version-format: string update-time: string writer-identity: string can be set completely with the following arguments which are assumed to be executed in the given order. Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time. -r .bigquery-options use-partitioned-tables=true Optional. Whether to use BigQuery's partition tables (https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/partitioned-tables). By default, Cloud Logging creates dated tables based on the log entries' timestamps, e.g. syslog_20170523. With partitioned tables the date suffix is no longer present and special query syntax (https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/querying-partitioned-tables) has to be used instead. In both cases, tables are sharded based on UTC timezone. uses-timestamp-column-partitioning=false Output only. True if new timestamp column based partitioning is in use, false if legacy ingress-time partitioning is in use.All new sinks will have this field set true and will use timestamp column based partitioning. If use_partitioned_tables is false, this value has no meaning and will be false. Legacy sinks using partitioned tables will have this field set to false. .. create-time=sit Output only. The creation timestamp of the sink.This field may not be present for older sinks. description=ipsum Optional. A description of this sink.The maximum length of the description is 8000 characters. destination=amet. Required. The export destination: \"storage.googleapis.com/[GCS_BUCKET]\" \"bigquery.googleapis.com/projects/[PROJECT_ID]/datasets/[DATASET]\" \"pubsub.googleapis.com/projects/[PROJECT_ID]/topics/[TOPIC_ID]\" \"logging.googleapis.com/projects/[PROJECT_ID]\" \"logging.googleapis.com/projects/[PROJECT_ID]/locations/[LOCATION_ID]/buckets/[BUCKET_ID]\" The sink's writer_identity, set when the sink is created, must have permission to write to the destination or else the log entries are not exported. For more information, see Exporting Logs with Sinks (https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/api/tasks/exporting-logs). disabled=false Optional. If set to true, then this sink is disabled and it does not export any log entries. filter=ut Optional. An advanced logs filter (https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/view/advanced-queries). The only exported log entries are those that are in the resource owning the sink and that match the filter.For example:logName=\"projects/[PROJECT_ID]/logs/[LOG_ID]\" AND severity>=ERROR include-children=true Optional. This field applies only to sinks owned by organizations and folders. If the field is false, the default, only the logs owned by the sink's parent resource are available for export. If the field is true, then log entries from all the projects, folders, and billing accounts contained in the sink's parent resource are also available for export. Whether a particular log entry from the children is exported depends on the sink's filter expression.For example, if this field is true, then the filter resource.type=gce_instance would export all Compute Engine VM instance log entries from all projects in the sink's parent.To only export entries from certain child projects, filter on the project part of the log name:logName:(\"projects/test-project1/\" OR \"projects/test-project2/\") AND resource.type=gce_instance name=at Output only. The client-assigned sink identifier, unique within the project.For example: \"my-syslog-errors-to-pubsub\".Sink identifiers are limited to 100 characters and can include only the following characters: upper and lower-case alphanumeric characters, underscores, hyphens, periods.First character has to be alphanumeric. output-version-format=sed Deprecated. This field is unused. update-time=stet Output only. The last update timestamp of the sink.This field may not be present for older sinks. writer-identity=sadipscing Output only. An IAM identity\u2014a service account or group\u2014under which Cloud Logging writes the exported log entries to the sink's destination. This field is either set by specifying custom_writer_identity or set automatically by sinks.create and sinks.update based on the value of unique_writer_identity in those methods.Until you grant this identity write-access to the destination, log entry exports from this sink will fail. For more information, see Granting Access for a Resource (https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/granting-roles-to-service-accounts#granting_access_to_a_service_account_for_a_resource). Consult the destination service's documentation to determine the appropriate IAM roles to assign to the identity.Sinks that have a destination that is a log bucket in the same project as the sink cannot have a writer_identity and no additional permissions are required. About Cursors The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. . Each additional . moves it up one additional level. E.g. ... would go three levels up. Optional Output Flags The method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default. -o out out specifies the destination to which to write the server's result to. It will be a JSON-encoded structure. The destination may be - to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes. If unset, it defaults to standard output. Optional Method Properties You may set the following properties to further configure the call. Please note that -p is followed by one or more key-value-pairs, and is called like this -p k1=v1 k2=v2 even though the listing below repeats the -p for completeness. -p custom-writer-identity=string Optional. A service account provided by the caller that will be used to write the log entries. The format must be serviceAccount:some@email. This field can only be specified if you are routing logs to a destination outside this sink's project. If not specified, a Logging service account will automatically be generated. -p unique-writer-identity=boolean Optional. See sinks.create for a description of this field. When updating a sink, the effect of this field on the value of writer_identity in the updated sink depends on both the old and new values of this field: If the old and new values of this field are both false or both true, then there is no change to the sink's writer_identity. If the old value is false and the new value is true, then writer_identity is changed to a service agent (https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-account-types#service-agents) owned by Cloud Logging. It is an error if the old value is true and the new value is set to false or defaulted to false. -p update-mask=string Optional. Field mask that specifies the fields in sink that need an update. A sink field will be overwritten if, and only if, it is in the update mask. name and output only fields cannot be updated.An empty updateMask is temporarily treated as using the following mask for backwards compatibility purposes:destination,filter,includeChildrenAt some point in the future, behavior will be removed and specifying an empty updateMask will be an error.For a detailed FieldMask definition, see https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/google.protobuf#google.protobuf.FieldMaskFor example: updateMask=filter Optional General Properties The following properties can configure any call, and are not specific to this method. -p $-xgafv=string V1 error format. -p access-token=string OAuth access token. -p alt=string Data format for response. -p callback=string JSONP -p fields=string Selector specifying which fields to include in a partial response. -p key=string API key.

Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time. -r .bigquery-options use-partitioned-tables=false Optional. Whether to use BigQuery's partition tables (https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/partitioned-tables). By default, Cloud Logging creates dated tables based on the log entries' timestamps, e.g. syslog_20170523. With partitioned tables the date suffix is no longer present and special query syntax (https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/querying-partitioned-tables) has to be used instead. In both cases, tables are sharded based on UTC timezone. uses-timestamp-column-partitioning=false Output only. True if new timestamp column based partitioning is in use, false if legacy ingress-time partitioning is in use.All new sinks will have this field set true and will use timestamp column based partitioning. If use_partitioned_tables is false, this value has no meaning and will be false. Legacy sinks using partitioned tables will have this field set to false. .. create-time=rebum. Output only. The creation timestamp of the sink.This field may not be present for older sinks. description=sanctus Optional. A description of this sink.The maximum length of the description is 8000 characters. destination=no Required. The export destination: \"storage.googleapis.com/[GCS_BUCKET]\" \"bigquery.googleapis.com/projects/[PROJECT_ID]/datasets/[DATASET]\" \"pubsub.googleapis.com/projects/[PROJECT_ID]/topics/[TOPIC_ID]\" \"logging.googleapis.com/projects/[PROJECT_ID]\" \"logging.googleapis.com/projects/[PROJECT_ID]/locations/[LOCATION_ID]/buckets/[BUCKET_ID]\" The sink's writer_identity, set when the sink is created, must have permission to write to the destination or else the log entries are not exported. For more information, see Exporting Logs with Sinks (https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/api/tasks/exporting-logs). disabled=true Optional. If set to true, then this sink is disabled and it does not export any log entries. filter=ipsum Optional. An advanced logs filter (https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/view/advanced-queries). The only exported log entries are those that are in the resource owning the sink and that match the filter.For example:logName=\"projects/[PROJECT_ID]/logs/[LOG_ID]\" AND severity>=ERROR include-children=false Optional. This field applies only to sinks owned by organizations and folders. If the field is false, the default, only the logs owned by the sink's parent resource are available for export. If the field is true, then log entries from all the projects, folders, and billing accounts contained in the sink's parent resource are also available for export. Whether a particular log entry from the children is exported depends on the sink's filter expression.For example, if this field is true, then the filter resource.type=gce_instance would export all Compute Engine VM instance log entries from all projects in the sink's parent.To only export entries from certain child projects, filter on the project part of the log name:logName:(\"projects/test-project1/\" OR \"projects/test-project2/\") AND resource.type=gce_instance name=justo Output only. The client-assigned sink identifier, unique within the project.For example: \"my-syslog-errors-to-pubsub\".Sink identifiers are limited to 100 characters and can include only the following characters: upper and lower-case alphanumeric characters, underscores, hyphens, periods.First character has to be alphanumeric. output-version-format=justo Deprecated. This field is unused. update-time=eirmod Output only. The last update timestamp of the sink.This field may not be present for older sinks. writer-identity=duo Output only. An IAM identity\u2014a service account or group\u2014under which Cloud Logging writes the exported log entries to the sink's destination. This field is either set by specifying custom_writer_identity or set automatically by sinks.create and sinks.update based on the value of unique_writer_identity in those methods.Until you grant this identity write-access to the destination, log entry exports from this sink will fail. For more information, see Granting Access for a Resource (https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/granting-roles-to-service-accounts#granting_access_to_a_service_account_for_a_resource). Consult the destination service's documentation to determine the appropriate IAM roles to assign to the identity.Sinks that have a destination that is a log bucket in the same project as the sink cannot have a writer_identity and no additional permissions are required. About Cursors The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. . Each additional . moves it up one additional level. E.g. ... would go three levels up. Optional Output Flags The method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default. -o out out specifies the destination to which to write the server's result to. It will be a JSON-encoded structure. The destination may be - to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes. If unset, it defaults to standard output. Optional Method Properties You may set the following properties to further configure the call. Please note that -p is followed by one or more key-value-pairs, and is called like this -p k1=v1 k2=v2 even though the listing below repeats the -p for completeness. -p custom-writer-identity=string Optional. A service account provided by the caller that will be used to write the log entries. The format must be serviceAccount:some@email. This field can only be specified if you are routing logs to a destination outside this sink's project. If not specified, a Logging service account will automatically be generated. -p unique-writer-identity=boolean Optional. See sinks.create for a description of this field. When updating a sink, the effect of this field on the value of writer_identity in the updated sink depends on both the old and new values of this field: If the old and new values of this field are both false or both true, then there is no change to the sink's writer_identity. If the old value is false and the new value is true, then writer_identity is changed to a service agent (https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-account-types#service-agents) owned by Cloud Logging. It is an error if the old value is true and the new value is set to false or defaulted to false. -p update-mask=string Optional. Field mask that specifies the fields in sink that need an update. A sink field will be overwritten if, and only if, it is in the update mask. name and output only fields cannot be updated.An empty updateMask is temporarily treated as using the following mask for backwards compatibility purposes:destination,filter,includeChildrenAt some point in the future, behavior will be removed and specifying an empty updateMask will be an error.For a detailed FieldMask definition, see https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/google.protobuf#google.protobuf.FieldMaskFor example: updateMask=filter Optional General Properties The following properties can configure any call, and are not specific to this method. -p $-xgafv=string V1 error format. -p access-token=string OAuth access token. -p alt=string Data format for response. -p callback=string JSONP -p fields=string Selector specifying which fields to include in a partial response. -p key=string API key.

Whether to use BigQuery's partition tables (https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/partitioned-tables). By default, Cloud Logging creates dated tables based on the log entries' timestamps, e.g. syslog_20170523. With partitioned tables the date suffix is no longer present and special query syntax (https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/querying-partitioned-tables) has to be used instead.

True if new timestamp column based partitioning is in use, false if legacy ingress-time partitioning is in use.All new sinks will have this field set true and will use timestamp column based partitioning. If use_partitioned_tables is false, this value has no meaning and will be false. Legacy sinks using partitioned tables will have this field set to false. .. create-time=amet Output only.

About Cursors The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly.

This field can only be specified if you are routing logs to a destination outside this sink's project. If not specified, a Logging service account will automatically be generated. -p unique-writer-identity=boolean Optional. See sinks.create for a description of this field. When updating a sink, the effect of this field on the value of writer_identity in the updated sink depends on both the old and new values of this field: If the old and new values of this field are both false or both true, then there is no change to the sink's writer_identity.

Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time. -r .bigquery-options use-partitioned-tables=true Optional. Whether to use BigQuery's partition tables (https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/partitioned-tables). By default, Cloud Logging creates dated tables based on the log entries' timestamps, e.g. syslog_20170523. With partitioned tables the date suffix is no longer present and special query syntax (https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/querying-partitioned-tables) has to be used instead. In both cases, tables are sharded based on UTC timezone. uses-timestamp-column-partitioning=true Output only. True if new timestamp column based partitioning is in use, false if legacy ingress-time partitioning is in use.All new sinks will have this field set true and will use timestamp column based partitioning. If use_partitioned_tables is false, this value has no meaning and will be false. Legacy sinks using partitioned tables will have this field set to false. .. create-time=amet Output only. The creation timestamp of the sink.This field may not be present for older sinks. description=magna Optional. A description of this sink.The maximum length of the description is 8000 characters. destination=sanctus Required. The export destination: \"storage.googleapis.com/[GCS_BUCKET]\" \"bigquery.googleapis.com/projects/[PROJECT_ID]/datasets/[DATASET]\" \"pubsub.googleapis.com/projects/[PROJECT_ID]/topics/[TOPIC_ID]\" \"logging.googleapis.com/projects/[PROJECT_ID]\" \"logging.googleapis.com/projects/[PROJECT_ID]/locations/[LOCATION_ID]/buckets/[BUCKET_ID]\" The sink's writer_identity, set when the sink is created, must have permission to write to the destination or else the log entries are not exported. For more information, see Exporting Logs with Sinks (https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/api/tasks/exporting-logs). disabled=false Optional. If set to true, then this sink is disabled and it does not export any log entries. filter=accusam Optional. An advanced logs filter (https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/view/advanced-queries). The only exported log entries are those that are in the resource owning the sink and that match the filter.For example:logName=\"projects/[PROJECT_ID]/logs/[LOG_ID]\" AND severity>=ERROR include-children=true Optional. This field applies only to sinks owned by organizations and folders. If the field is false, the default, only the logs owned by the sink's parent resource are available for export. If the field is true, then log entries from all the projects, folders, and billing accounts contained in the sink's parent resource are also available for export. Whether a particular log entry from the children is exported depends on the sink's filter expression.For example, if this field is true, then the filter resource.type=gce_instance would export all Compute Engine VM instance log entries from all projects in the sink's parent.To only export entries from certain child projects, filter on the project part of the log name:logName:(\"projects/test-project1/\" OR \"projects/test-project2/\") AND resource.type=gce_instance name=sanctus Output only. The client-assigned sink identifier, unique within the project.For example: \"my-syslog-errors-to-pubsub\".Sink identifiers are limited to 100 characters and can include only the following characters: upper and lower-case alphanumeric characters, underscores, hyphens, periods.First character has to be alphanumeric. output-version-format=invidunt Deprecated. This field is unused. update-time=sit Output only. The last update timestamp of the sink.This field may not be present for older sinks. writer-identity=sed Output only. An IAM identity\u2014a service account or group\u2014under which Cloud Logging writes the exported log entries to the sink's destination. This field is either set by specifying custom_writer_identity or set automatically by sinks.create and sinks.update based on the value of unique_writer_identity in those methods.Until you grant this identity write-access to the destination, log entry exports from this sink will fail. For more information, see Granting Access for a Resource (https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/granting-roles-to-service-accounts#granting_access_to_a_service_account_for_a_resource). Consult the destination service's documentation to determine the appropriate IAM roles to assign to the identity.Sinks that have a destination that is a log bucket in the same project as the sink cannot have a writer_identity and no additional permissions are required.","title":"Required Request Value"},{"location":"sinks_update/#about-cursors","text":"The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. .

A service account provided by the caller that will be used to write the log entries. The format must be serviceAccount:some@email. This field can only be specified if you are routing logs to a destination outside this sink's project. If not specified, a Logging service account will automatically be generated. -p unique-writer-identity=boolean Optional. See sinks.create for a description of this field. When updating a sink, the effect of this field on the value of writer_identity in the updated sink depends on both the old and new values of this field: If the old and new values of this field are both false or both true, then there is no change to the sink's writer_identity. If the old value is false and the new value is true, then writer_identity is changed to a service agent (https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-account-types#service-agents) owned by Cloud Logging. It is an error if the old value is true and the new value is set to false or defaulted to false. -p update-mask=string Optional. Field mask that specifies the fields in sink that need an update. A sink field will be overwritten if, and only if, it is in the update mask. name and output only fields cannot be updated.An empty updateMask is temporarily treated as using the following mask for backwards compatibility purposes:destination,filter,includeChildrenAt some point in the future, behavior will be removed and specifying an empty updateMask will be an error.For a detailed FieldMask definition, see https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/google.protobuf#google.protobuf.FieldMaskFor example: updateMask=filter","title":"Optional Method Properties"},{"location":"sinks_update/#optional-general-properties","text":"The following properties can configure any call, and are not specific to this method. -p $-xgafv=string V1 error format. -p access-token=string OAuth access token. -p alt=string Data format for response. -p callback=string JSONP -p fields=string Selector specifying which fields to include in a partial response. -p key=string API key.
