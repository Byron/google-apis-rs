By default all output is printed to standard out, but flags can be set to direct it into a file independent of your shell's capabilities. Errors will be printed to standard error, and cause the program's exit code to be non-zero. If data-structures are requested, these will be returned as pretty-printed JSON, to be useful as input to other tools. Everything else about the Dataproc API can be found at the official documentation site . Installation and Source Code Install the command-line interface with cargo using: cargo install google-dataproc1-cli Find the source code on github .

[-o <out>] dataproc1 --help Configuration: [--scope <url>]... Specify the authentication a method should be executed in. Each scope requires the user to grant this application permission to use it. If unset, it defaults to the shortest scope url for a particular method. --config-dir <folder> A directory into which we will store our persistent data. Defaults to a user-writable directory that we will create during the first invocation. [default: ~/.google-service-cli] Configuration The program will store all persistent data in the ~/.google-service-cli directory in JSON files prefixed with dataproc1- . You can change the directory used to store configuration with the --config-dir flag on a per-invocation basis. More information about the various kinds of persistent data are given in the following paragraphs. Authentication Most APIs require a user to authenticate any request. If this is the case, the scope determines the set of permissions granted. The granularity of these is usually no more than read-only or full-access . If not set, the system will automatically select the smallest feasible scope, e.g. when invoking a method that is read-only, it will ask only for a read-only scope. You may use the --scope flag to specify a scope directly. All applicable scopes are documented in the respective method's CLI documentation. The first time a scope is used, the user is asked for permission. Follow the instructions given by the CLI to grant permissions, or to decline. If a scope was authenticated by the user, the respective information will be stored as JSON in the configuration directory, e.g. ~/.google-service-cli/dataproc1-token-<scope-hash>.json . No manual management of these tokens is necessary. To revoke granted authentication, please refer to the official documentation . Application Secrets In order to allow any application to use Google services, it will need to be registered using the Google Developer Console . APIs the application may use are then enabled for it one by one. Most APIs can be used for free and have a daily quota. To allow more comfortable usage of the CLI without forcing anyone to register an own application, the CLI comes with a default application secret that is configured accordingly. This also means that heavy usage all around the world may deplete the daily quota. You can workaround this limitation by putting your own secrets file at this location: ~/.google-service-cli/dataproc1-secret.json , assuming that the required dataproc API was enabled for it. Such a secret file can be downloaded in the Google Developer Console at APIs & auth -> Credentials -> Download JSON and used as is. Learn more about how to setup Google projects and enable APIs using the official documentation . Debugging Even though the CLI does its best to provide usable error messages, sometimes it might be desirable to know what exactly led to a particular issue. This is done by allowing all client-server communication to be output to standard error as-is . The --debug flag will print errors using the Debug representation to standard error. You may consider redirecting standard error into a file for ease of use, e.g. dataproc1 --debug <resource> <method> [options] 2>debug.txt .","title":"Home"},{"location":"#installation-and-source-code","text":"Install the command-line interface with cargo using: cargo install google-dataproc1-cli Find the source code on github .","title":"Installation and Source Code"},{"location":"#usage","text":"This documentation was generated from the Dataproc API at revision 20240222 .

Each field may be a simple scalar or another data-structure. In the latter case it is advised to set the field-cursor to the data-structure's field to specify values more concisely. For example, a structure like this: AutoscalingPolicy: basic-algorithm: cooldown-period: string spark-standalone-config: graceful-decommission-timeout: string remove-only-idle-workers: boolean scale-down-factor: number scale-down-min-worker-fraction: number scale-up-factor: number scale-up-min-worker-fraction: number yarn-config: graceful-decommission-timeout: string scale-down-factor: number scale-down-min-worker-fraction: number scale-up-factor: number scale-up-min-worker-fraction: number id: string labels: { string: string } name: string secondary-worker-config: max-instances: integer min-instances: integer weight: integer worker-config: max-instances: integer min-instances: integer weight: integer can be set completely with the following arguments which are assumed to be executed in the given order. Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time. -r .basic-algorithm cooldown-period=et Optional. Duration between scaling events. A scaling period starts after the update operation from the previous event has completed.Bounds: 2m, 1d. Default: 2m. spark-standalone-config graceful-decommission-timeout=magna Required. Timeout for Spark graceful decommissioning of spark workers. Specifies the duration to wait for spark worker to complete spark decommissioning tasks before forcefully removing workers. Only applicable to downscaling operations.Bounds: 0s, 1d. remove-only-idle-workers=true Optional. Remove only idle workers when scaling down cluster scale-down-factor=0.5709789811505924 Required. Fraction of required executors to remove from Spark Serverless clusters. A scale-down factor of 1.0 will result in scaling down so that there are no more executors for the Spark Job.(more aggressive scaling). A scale-down factor closer to 0 will result in a smaller magnitude of scaling donw (less aggressive scaling).Bounds: 0.0, 1.0. scale-down-min-worker-fraction=0.7318948296136206 Optional. Minimum scale-down threshold as a fraction of total cluster size before scaling occurs. For example, in a 20-worker cluster, a threshold of 0.1 means the autoscaler must recommend at least a 2 worker scale-down for the cluster to scale. A threshold of 0 means the autoscaler will scale down on any recommended change.Bounds: 0.0, 1.0. Default: 0.0. scale-up-factor=0.7751996280578802 Required. Fraction of required workers to add to Spark Standalone clusters. A scale-up factor of 1.0 will result in scaling up so that there are no more required workers for the Spark Job (more aggressive scaling). A scale-up factor closer to 0 will result in a smaller magnitude of scaling up (less aggressive scaling).Bounds: 0.0, 1.0. scale-up-min-worker-fraction=0.3327893270828187 Optional. Minimum scale-up threshold as a fraction of total cluster size before scaling occurs. For example, in a 20-worker cluster, a threshold of 0.1 means the autoscaler must recommend at least a 2-worker scale-up for the cluster to scale. A threshold of 0 means the autoscaler will scale up on any recommended change.Bounds: 0.0, 1.0. Default: 0.0. ..yarn-config graceful-decommission-timeout=duo Required. Timeout for YARN graceful decommissioning of Node Managers. Specifies the duration to wait for jobs to complete before forcefully removing workers (and potentially interrupting jobs). Only applicable to downscaling operations.Bounds: 0s, 1d. scale-down-factor=0.7896128249156874 Required. Fraction of average YARN pending memory in the last cooldown period for which to remove workers. A scale-down factor of 1 will result in scaling down so that there is no available memory remaining after the update (more aggressive scaling). A scale-down factor of 0 disables removing workers, which can be beneficial for autoscaling a single job. See How autoscaling works (https://cloud.google.com/dataproc/docs/concepts/configuring-clusters/autoscaling#how_autoscaling_works) for more information.Bounds: 0.0, 1.0. scale-down-min-worker-fraction=0.9217265098962596 Optional. Minimum scale-down threshold as a fraction of total cluster size before scaling occurs.

About Cursors The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. . Each additional . moves it up one additional level. E.g. ... would go three levels up.

About Cursors The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. . Each additional . moves it up one additional level. E.g. ... would go three levels up.

Each field may be a simple scalar or another data-structure. In the latter case it is advised to set the field-cursor to the data-structure's field to specify values more concisely. For example, a structure like this: SessionTemplate: create-time: string creator: string description: string environment-config: execution-config: idle-ttl: string kms-key: string network-tags: [string] network-uri: string service-account: string staging-bucket: string subnetwork-uri: string ttl: string peripherals-config: metastore-service: string spark-history-server-config: dataproc-cluster: string jupyter-session: display-name: string kernel: string labels: { string: string } name: string runtime-config: container-image: string properties: { string: string } repository-config: pypi-repository-config: pypi-repository: string version: string update-time: string uuid: string can be set completely with the following arguments which are assumed to be executed in the given order. Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time. -r . create-time=lorem Output only. The time when the template was created. creator=est Output only. The email address of the user who created the template. description=sed Optional. Brief description of the template. environment-config.execution-config idle-ttl=diam Optional. Applies to sessions only. The duration to keep the session alive while it's idling. Exceeding this threshold causes the session to terminate. This field cannot be set on a batch workload. Minimum value is 10 minutes; maximum value is 14 days (see JSON representation of Duration (https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto3#json)). Defaults to 1 hour if not set. If both ttl and idle_ttl are specified for an interactive session, the conditions are treated as OR conditions: the workload will be terminated when it has been idle for idle_ttl or when ttl has been exceeded, whichever occurs first. kms-key=dolores Optional. The Cloud KMS key to use for encryption. network-tags=dolores Optional. Tags used for network traffic control. Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. network-uri=et Optional. Network URI to connect workload to. service-account=sed Optional. Service account that used to execute workload. staging-bucket=no Optional. A Cloud Storage bucket used to stage workload dependencies, config files, and store workload output and other ephemeral data, such as Spark history files. If you do not specify a staging bucket, Cloud Dataproc will determine a Cloud Storage location according to the region where your workload is running, and then create and manage project-level, per-location staging and temporary buckets. This field requires a Cloud Storage bucket name, not a gs://... URI to a Cloud Storage bucket. subnetwork-uri=et Optional. Subnetwork URI to connect workload to. ttl=elitr Optional. The duration after which the workload will be terminated, specified as the JSON representation for Duration (https://protobuf.dev/programming-guides/proto3/#json). When the workload exceeds this duration, it will be unconditionally terminated without waiting for ongoing work to finish. If ttl is not specified for a batch workload, the workload will be allowed to run until it exits naturally (or run forever without exiting). If ttl is not specified for an interactive session, it defaults to 24 hours. If ttl is not specified for a batch that uses 2.1+ runtime version, it defaults to 4 hours. Minimum value is 10 minutes; maximum value is 14 days. If both ttl and idle_ttl are specified (for an interactive session), the conditions are treated as OR conditions: the workload will be terminated when it has been idle for idle_ttl or when ttl has been exceeded, whichever occurs first. ..peripherals-config metastore-service=sed Optional. Resource name of an existing Dataproc Metastore service.Example: projects/[project_id]/locations/[region]/services/[service_id] spark-history-server-config dataproc-cluster=no Optional. Resource name of an existing Dataproc Cluster to act as a Spark History Server for the workload.Example: projects/[project_id]/regions/[region]/clusters/[cluster_name] ....jupyter-session display-name=nonumy Optional. Display name, shown in the Jupyter kernelspec card. kernel=at Optional. Kernel .. labels=key=sadipscing Optional. Labels to associate with sessions created using this template. Label keys must contain 1 to 63 characters, and must conform to RFC 1035 (https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1035.txt). Label values can be empty, but, if present, must contain 1 to 63 characters and conform to RFC 1035 (https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1035.txt). No more than 32 labels can be associated with a session. the value will be associated with the given key name=aliquyam Required. The resource name of the session template. runtime-config container-image=dolores Optional. Optional custom container image for the job runtime environment. If not specified, a default container image will be used. properties=key=sadipscing Optional. A mapping of property names to values, which are used to configure workload execution. the value will be associated with the given key repository-config.pypi-repository-config pypi-repository=erat Optional. PyPi repository address ... version=aliquyam Optional. Version of the batch runtime. .. update-time=amet Output only. The time the template was last updated. uuid=est Output only. A session template UUID (Unique Universal Identifier). The service generates this value when it creates the session template. About Cursors The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. . Each additional . moves it up one additional level. E.g. ... would go three levels up. Optional Output Flags The method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default. -o out out specifies the destination to which to write the server's result to. It will be a JSON-encoded structure. The destination may be - to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes. If unset, it defaults to standard output.

The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. .

The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. . Each additional . moves it up one additional level. E.g. ... would go three levels up.

For example, if max_instances for secondary workers is 0, then only primary workers will be added. The cluster can also be out of balance when created.If weight is not set on any instance group, the cluster will default to equal weight for all groups: the cluster will attempt to maintain an equal number of workers in each group within the configured size bounds for each group. If weight is set for one group only, the cluster will default to zero weight on the unset group.

Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time. -r .policy etag=diam etag is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help prevent simultaneous updates of a policy from overwriting each other. It is strongly suggested that systems make use of the etag in the read-modify-write cycle to perform policy updates in order to avoid race conditions: An etag is returned in the response to getIamPolicy, and systems are expected to put that etag in the request to setIamPolicy to ensure that their change will be applied to the same version of the policy.Important: If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the etag field whenever you call setIamPolicy. If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to overwrite a version 3 policy with a version 1 policy, and all of the conditions in the version 3 policy are lost. version=9 Specifies the format of the policy.Valid values are 0, 1, and 3. Requests that specify an invalid value are rejected.Any operation that affects conditional role bindings must specify version 3. This requirement applies to the following operations: Getting a policy that includes a conditional role binding Adding a conditional role binding to a policy Changing a conditional role binding in a policy Removing any role binding, with or without a condition, from a policy that includes conditionsImportant: If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the etag field whenever you call setIamPolicy. If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to overwrite a version 3 policy with a version 1 policy, and all of the conditions in the version 3 policy are lost.If a policy does not include any conditions, operations on that policy may specify any valid version or leave the field unset.To learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the IAM documentation (https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies).

In the latter case it is advised to set the field-cursor to the data-structure's field to specify values more concisely. For example, a structure like this: StartClusterRequest: cluster-uuid: string request-id: string can be set completely with the following arguments which are assumed to be executed in the given order. Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time. -r . cluster-uuid=erat Optional. Specifying the cluster_uuid means the RPC will fail (with error NOT_FOUND) if a cluster with the specified UUID does not exist. request-id=accusam Optional. A unique ID used to identify the request. If the server receives two StartClusterRequest (https://cloud.google.com/dataproc/docs/reference/rpc/google.cloud.dataproc.v1#google.cloud.dataproc.v1.StartClusterRequest)s with the same id, then the second request will be ignored and the first google.longrunning.Operation created and stored in the backend is returned.Recommendation: Set this value to a UUID (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier).The ID must contain only letters (a-z, A-Z), numbers (0-9), underscores (_), and hyphens (-). The maximum length is 40 characters. About Cursors The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. . Each additional . moves it up one additional level. E.g. ... would go three levels up.

About Cursors The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. . Each additional . moves it up one additional level. E.g. ... would go three levels up. Optional Output Flags The method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default. -o out out specifies the destination to which to write the server's result to. It will be a JSON-encoded structure. The destination may be - to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes. If unset, it defaults to standard output. Optional Method Properties You may set the following properties to further configure the call. Please note that -p is followed by one or more key-value-pairs, and is called like this -p k1=v1 k2=v2 even though the listing below repeats the -p for completeness. -p update-mask=string Required. Specifies the path, relative to Job, of the field to update. For example, to update the labels of a Job the update_mask parameter would be specified as labels, and the PATCH request body would specify the new value. Note: Currently, labels is the only field that can be updated. Optional General Properties The following properties can configure any call, and are not specific to this method. -p $-xgafv=string V1 error format. -p access-token=string OAuth access token. -p alt=string Data format for response. -p callback=string JSONP -p fields=string Selector specifying which fields to include in a partial response. -p key=string API key.

The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. . Each additional . moves it up one additional level. E.g. ... would go three levels up.

Required Scalar Argument <resource> (string) REQUIRED: The resource for which the policy detail is being requested. See Resource names (https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/resource_names) for the appropriate value for this field. Required Request Value The request value is a data-structure with various fields. Each field may be a simple scalar or another data-structure. In the latter case it is advised to set the field-cursor to the data-structure's field to specify values more concisely. For example, a structure like this: TestIamPermissionsRequest: permissions: [string] can be set completely with the following arguments which are assumed to be executed in the given order. Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time. -r . permissions=accusam The set of permissions to check for the resource. Permissions with wildcards (such as * or storage.*) are not allowed. For more information see IAM Overview (https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/overview#permissions). Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. About Cursors The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. . Each additional . moves it up one additional level. E.g. ... would go three levels up. Optional Output Flags The method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default. -o out out specifies the destination to which to write the server's result to.

The default bucket has a TTL of 90 days, but you can use any TTL (or none) if you specify a bucket (see Dataproc staging and temp buckets (https://cloud.google.com/dataproc/docs/concepts/configuring-clusters/staging-bucket)). This field requires a Cloud Storage bucket name, not a gs://... URI to a Cloud Storage bucket. worker-config.disk-config boot-disk-size-gb=47 Optional. Size in GB of the boot disk (default is 500GB). boot-disk-type=ut Optional. Type of the boot disk (default is \"pd-standard\").

Valid values: \"scsi\" (Small Computer System Interface), \"nvme\" (Non-Volatile Memory Express). See local SSD performance (https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/local-ssd#performance). num-local-ssds=54 Optional. Number of attached SSDs, from 0 to 8 (default is 0). If SSDs are not attached, the boot disk is used to store runtime logs and HDFS (https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/r1.2.1/hdfs_user_guide.html) data. If one or more SSDs are attached, this runtime bulk data is spread across them, and the boot disk contains only basic config and installed binaries.Note: Local SSD options may vary by machine type and number of vCPUs selected. .. image-uri=elitr Optional. The Compute Engine image resource used for cluster instances.The URI can represent an image or image family.Image examples: https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/[project_id]/global/images/[image-id] projects/[project_id]/global/images/[image-id] image-idImage family examples. Dataproc will use the most recent image from the family: https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/[project_id]/global/images/family/[custom-image-family-name] projects/[project_id]/global/images/family/[custom-image-family-name]If the URI is unspecified, it will be inferred from SoftwareConfig.image_version or the system default. instance-names=amet. Output only. The list of instance names. Dataproc derives the names from cluster_name, num_instances, and the instance group. Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. is-preemptible=false Output only. Specifies that this instance group contains preemptible instances. machine-type-uri=amet. Optional. The Compute Engine machine type used for cluster instances.A full URL, partial URI, or short name are valid. Examples: https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/[project_id]/zones/[zone]/machineTypes/n1-standard-2 projects/[project_id]/zones/[zone]/machineTypes/n1-standard-2 n1-standard-2Auto Zone Exception: If you are using the Dataproc Auto Zone Placement (https://cloud.google.com/dataproc/docs/concepts/configuring-clusters/auto-zone#using_auto_zone_placement) feature, you must use the short name of the machine type resource, for example, n1-standard-2. managed-group-config instance-group-manager-name=accusam Output only. The name of the Instance Group Manager for this group. instance-group-manager-uri=et Output only. The partial URI to the instance group manager for this group. E.g. projects/my-project/regions/us-central1/instanceGroupManagers/my-igm. instance-template-name=amet Output only. The name of the Instance Template used for the Managed Instance Group. .. min-cpu-platform=sea Optional. Specifies the minimum cpu platform for the Instance Group. See Dataproc -> Minimum CPU Platform (https://cloud.google.com/dataproc/docs/concepts/compute/dataproc-min-cpu). min-num-instances=83 Optional. The minimum number of primary worker instances to create. If min_num_instances is set, cluster creation will succeed if the number of primary workers created is at least equal to the min_num_instances number.Example: Cluster creation request with num_instances = 5 and min_num_instances = 3: If 4 VMs are created and 1 instance fails, the failed VM is deleted. The cluster is resized to 4 instances and placed in a RUNNING state. If 2 instances are created and 3 instances fail, the cluster in placed in an ERROR state. The failed VMs are not deleted. num-instances=66 Optional. The number of VM instances in the instance group. For HA cluster master_config groups, must be set to 3. For standard cluster master_config groups, must be set to 1. preemptibility=et Optional. Specifies the preemptibility of the instance group.The default value for master and worker groups is NON_PREEMPTIBLE. This default cannot be changed.The default value for secondary instances is PREEMPTIBLE. startup-config required-registration-fraction=0.7964521835436621 Optional. The config setting to enable cluster creation/ updation to be successful only after required_registration_fraction of instances are up and running. This configuration is applicable to only secondary workers for now. The cluster will fail if required_registration_fraction of instances are not available. This will include instance creation, agent registration, and service registration (if enabled). .... labels=key=dolores Optional. The labels to associate with this cluster.Label keys must be between 1 and 63 characters long, and must conform to the following PCRE regular expression: \\p{Ll}\\p{Lo}{0,62}Label values must be between 1 and 63 characters long, and must conform to the following PCRE regular expression: \\p{Ll}\\p{Lo}\\p{N}_-{0,63}No more than 32 labels can be associated with a given cluster. the value will be associated with the given key ... update-time=no Output only. The time template was last updated. version=24 Optional. Used to perform a consistent read-modify-write.This field should be left blank for a CreateWorkflowTemplate request. It is required for an UpdateWorkflowTemplate request, and must match the current server version. A typical update template flow would fetch the current template with a GetWorkflowTemplate request, which will return the current template with the version field filled in with the current server version.

The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. . Each additional . moves it up one additional level. E.g. ... would go three levels up.

The default bucket has a TTL of 90 days, but you can use any TTL (or none) if you specify a bucket (see Dataproc staging and temp buckets (https://cloud.google.com/dataproc/docs/concepts/configuring-clusters/staging-bucket)). This field requires a Cloud Storage bucket name, not a gs://... URI to a Cloud Storage bucket. worker-config.disk-config boot-disk-size-gb=81 Optional. Size in GB of the boot disk (default is 500GB). boot-disk-type=dolor Optional. Type of the boot disk (default is \"pd-standard\"). Valid values: \"pd-balanced\" (Persistent Disk Balanced Solid State Drive), \"pd-ssd\" (Persistent Disk Solid State Drive), or \"pd-standard\" (Persistent Disk Hard Disk Drive). See Disk types (https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks#disk-types). local-ssd-interface=ea Optional. Interface type of local SSDs (default is \"scsi\"). Valid values: \"scsi\" (Small Computer System Interface), \"nvme\" (Non-Volatile Memory Express). See local SSD performance (https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/local-ssd#performance). num-local-ssds=71 Optional. Number of attached SSDs, from 0 to 8 (default is 0). If SSDs are not attached, the boot disk is used to store runtime logs and HDFS (https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/r1.2.1/hdfs_user_guide.html) data. If one or more SSDs are attached, this runtime bulk data is spread across them, and the boot disk contains only basic config and installed binaries.Note: Local SSD options may vary by machine type and number of vCPUs selected. .. image-uri=dolor Optional. The Compute Engine image resource used for cluster instances.The URI can represent an image or image family.Image examples: https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/[project_id]/global/images/[image-id] projects/[project_id]/global/images/[image-id] image-idImage family examples. Dataproc will use the most recent image from the family: https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/[project_id]/global/images/family/[custom-image-family-name] projects/[project_id]/global/images/family/[custom-image-family-name]If the URI is unspecified, it will be inferred from SoftwareConfig.image_version or the system default. instance-names=takimata Output only. The list of instance names. Dataproc derives the names from cluster_name, num_instances, and the instance group. Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. is-preemptible=false Output only. Specifies that this instance group contains preemptible instances. machine-type-uri=eirmod Optional. The Compute Engine machine type used for cluster instances.A full URL, partial URI, or short name are valid. Examples: https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/[project_id]/zones/[zone]/machineTypes/n1-standard-2 projects/[project_id]/zones/[zone]/machineTypes/n1-standard-2 n1-standard-2Auto Zone Exception: If you are using the Dataproc Auto Zone Placement (https://cloud.google.com/dataproc/docs/concepts/configuring-clusters/auto-zone#using_auto_zone_placement) feature, you must use the short name of the machine type resource, for example, n1-standard-2. managed-group-config instance-group-manager-name=voluptua. Output only. The name of the Instance Group Manager for this group. instance-group-manager-uri=nonumy Output only. The partial URI to the instance group manager for this group. E.g. projects/my-project/regions/us-central1/instanceGroupManagers/my-igm. instance-template-name=ut Output only. The name of the Instance Template used for the Managed Instance Group. .. min-cpu-platform=diam Optional. Specifies the minimum cpu platform for the Instance Group. See Dataproc -> Minimum CPU Platform (https://cloud.google.com/dataproc/docs/concepts/compute/dataproc-min-cpu). min-num-instances=67 Optional. The minimum number of primary worker instances to create. If min_num_instances is set, cluster creation will succeed if the number of primary workers created is at least equal to the min_num_instances number.Example: Cluster creation request with num_instances = 5 and min_num_instances = 3: If 4 VMs are created and 1 instance fails, the failed VM is deleted. The cluster is resized to 4 instances and placed in a RUNNING state. If 2 instances are created and 3 instances fail, the cluster in placed in an ERROR state. The failed VMs are not deleted. num-instances=89 Optional. The number of VM instances in the instance group. For HA cluster master_config groups, must be set to 3. For standard cluster master_config groups, must be set to 1. preemptibility=ea Optional. Specifies the preemptibility of the instance group.The default value for master and worker groups is NON_PREEMPTIBLE. This default cannot be changed.The default value for secondary instances is PREEMPTIBLE. startup-config required-registration-fraction=0.1420757739435693 Optional. The config setting to enable cluster creation/ updation to be successful only after required_registration_fraction of instances are up and running. This configuration is applicable to only secondary workers for now. The cluster will fail if required_registration_fraction of instances are not available. This will include instance creation, agent registration, and service registration (if enabled). .... labels=key=est Optional. The labels to associate with this cluster.Label keys must be between 1 and 63 characters long, and must conform to the following PCRE regular expression: \\p{Ll}\\p{Lo}{0,62}Label values must be between 1 and 63 characters long, and must conform to the following PCRE regular expression: \\p{Ll}\\p{Lo}\\p{N}_-{0,63}No more than 32 labels can be associated with a given cluster. the value will be associated with the given key ... update-time=sea Output only. The time template was last updated. version=46 Optional. Used to perform a consistent read-modify-write.This field should be left blank for a CreateWorkflowTemplate request. It is required for an UpdateWorkflowTemplate request, and must match the current server version. A typical update template flow would fetch the current template with a GetWorkflowTemplate request, which will return the current template with the version field filled in with the current server version. The user updates other fields in the template, then returns it as part of the UpdateWorkflowTemplate request.","title":"Required Request Value"},{"location":"projects_regions-workflow-templates-update/#about-cursors","text":"The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures.
