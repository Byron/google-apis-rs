By default all output is printed to standard out, but flags can be set to direct it into a file independent of your shell's capabilities. Errors will be printed to standard error, and cause the program's exit code to be non-zero. If data-structures are requested, these will be returned as pretty-printed JSON, to be useful as input to other tools. Everything else about the Firebase Hosting API can be found at the official documentation site . Installation and Source Code Install the command-line interface with cargo using: cargo install google-firebasehosting1_beta1-cli Find the source code on github .

Specify the authentication a method should be executed in. Each scope requires the user to grant this application permission to use it. If unset, it defaults to the shortest scope url for a particular method. --config-dir <folder> A directory into which we will store our persistent data. Defaults to a user-writable directory that we will create during the first invocation. [default: ~/.google-service-cli] Configuration The program will store all persistent data in the ~/.google-service-cli directory in JSON files prefixed with firebasehosting1-beta1- . You can change the directory used to store configuration with the --config-dir flag on a per-invocation basis. More information about the various kinds of persistent data are given in the following paragraphs. Authentication Most APIs require a user to authenticate any request. If this is the case, the scope determines the set of permissions granted. The granularity of these is usually no more than read-only or full-access . If not set, the system will automatically select the smallest feasible scope, e.g. when invoking a method that is read-only, it will ask only for a read-only scope. You may use the --scope flag to specify a scope directly. All applicable scopes are documented in the respective method's CLI documentation. The first time a scope is used, the user is asked for permission. Follow the instructions given by the CLI to grant permissions, or to decline. If a scope was authenticated by the user, the respective information will be stored as JSON in the configuration directory, e.g. ~/.google-service-cli/firebasehosting1-beta1-token-<scope-hash>.json . No manual management of these tokens is necessary. To revoke granted authentication, please refer to the official documentation . Application Secrets In order to allow any application to use Google services, it will need to be registered using the Google Developer Console . APIs the application may use are then enabled for it one by one. Most APIs can be used for free and have a daily quota. To allow more comfortable usage of the CLI without forcing anyone to register an own application, the CLI comes with a default application secret that is configured accordingly. This also means that heavy usage all around the world may deplete the daily quota. You can workaround this limitation by putting your own secrets file at this location: ~/.google-service-cli/firebasehosting1-beta1-secret.json , assuming that the required firebasehosting API was enabled for it. Such a secret file can be downloaded in the Google Developer Console at APIs & auth -> Credentials -> Download JSON and used as is. Learn more about how to setup Google projects and enable APIs using the official documentation . Debugging Even though the CLI does its best to provide usable error messages, sometimes it might be desirable to know what exactly led to a particular issue. This is done by allowing all client-server communication to be output to standard error as-is . The --debug flag will print errors using the Debug representation to standard error. You may consider redirecting standard error into a file for ease of use, e.g. firebasehosting1-beta1 --debug <resource> <method> [options] 2>debug.txt .","title":"Home"},{"location":"#installation-and-source-code","text":"Install the command-line interface with cargo using: cargo install google-firebasehosting1_beta1-cli Find the source code on github .","title":"Installation and Source Code"},{"location":"#usage","text":"This documentation was generated from the Firebase Hosting API at revision 20240303 .

Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time. -r . create-time=et Output only. The time at which the channel was created. expire-time=magna The time at which the channel will be automatically deleted. If null, the channel will not be automatically deleted. This field is present in the output whether it's set directly or via the ttl field. labels=key=no Text labels used for extra metadata and/or filtering. the value will be associated with the given key name=ipsum The fully-qualified resource name for the channel, in the format: sites/ SITE_ID/channels/CHANNEL_ID release message=voluptua. The deploy description when the release was created. The value can be up to 512 characters. name=at Output only. The unique identifier for the release, in either of the following formats: - sites/SITE_ID/releases/RELEASE_ID - sites/SITE_ID/channels/CHANNEL_ID/releases/RELEASE_ID This name is provided in the response body when you call releases.create or channels.releases.create . release-time=sanctus Output only. The time at which the version is set to be public. release-user email=sed The email address of the user when the user performed the action. image-url=amet. A profile image URL for the user. May not be present if the user has changed their email address or deleted their account. .. type=takimata Explains the reason for the release. Specify a value for this field only when creating a SITE_DISABLE type release. version.config app-association=amet. How to handle well known App Association files. clean-urls=true Defines whether to drop the file extension from uploaded files. i18n root=gubergren Required. The user-supplied path where country and language specific content will be looked for within the public directory. .. trailing-slash-behavior=lorem Defines how to handle a trailing slash in the URL path. .. create-time=gubergren Output only. The time at which the version was created. create-user email=eos The email address of the user when the user performed the action. image-url=dolor A profile image URL for the user. May not be present if the user has changed their email address or deleted their account. .. delete-time=ea Output only. The time at which the version was DELETED . delete-user email=ipsum The email address of the user when the user performed the action. image-url=invidunt A profile image URL for the user.

The time at which the version was FINALIZED . finalize-user email=ipsum The email address of the user when the user performed the action. image-url=sed A profile image URL for the user. May not be present if the user has changed their email address or deleted their account. .. labels=key=ut The labels used for extra metadata and/or filtering. the value will be associated with the given key name=gubergren The fully-qualified resource name for the version, in the format: sites/ SITE_ID/versions/VERSION_ID This name is provided in the response body when you call CreateVersion . status=rebum. The deploy status of the version. For a successful deploy, call CreateVersion to make a new version ( CREATED status), upload all desired files to the version, then update the version to the FINALIZED status. Note that if you leave the version in the CREATED state for more than 12 hours, the system will automatically mark the version as ABANDONED . You can also change the status of a version to DELETED by calling DeleteVersion . version-bytes=est Output only. The total stored bytesize of the version. This value is calculated after a version is FINALIZED . ... retained-release-count=51 The number of previous releases to retain on the channel for rollback or other purposes. Must be a number between 1-100. Defaults to 10 for new channels. ttl=ipsum Input only. A time-to-live for this channel. Sets expire_time to the provided duration past the time of the request. update-time=est Output only. The time at which the channel was last updated. url=gubergren Output only. The URL at which the content of this channel's current release can be viewed. This URL is a Firebase-provided subdomain of web.app . The content of this channel's current release can also be viewed at the Firebase-provided subdomain of firebaseapp.com . If this channel is the live channel for the Hosting site, then the content of this channel's current release can also be viewed at any connected custom domains. About Cursors The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. . Each additional . moves it up one additional level. E.g. ... would go three levels up. Optional Output Flags The method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default. -o out out specifies the destination to which to write the server's result to. It will be a JSON-encoded structure. The destination may be - to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes. If unset, it defaults to standard output. Optional Method Properties You may set the following properties to further configure the call. Please note that -p is followed by one or more key-value-pairs, and is called like this -p k1=v1 k2=v2 even though the listing below repeats the -p for completeness. -p channel-id=string Required.

A field that, if true, indicates that Hosting's systems are attmepting to make the custom domain's state match your preferred state. This is most frequently true when initially provisioning a CustomDomain after a CreateCustomDomain request or when creating a new SSL certificate to match an updated cert_preference after an UpdateCustomDomain request. redirect-target=est A domain name that this CustomDomain should direct traffic towards. If specified, Hosting will respond to requests against this custom domain with an HTTP 301 code, and route traffic to the specified redirect_target instead. required-dns-updates check-time=sit The last time Hosting checked your custom domain's DNS records. .. update-time=sed Output only. The last time the CustomDomain was updated. About Cursors The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. . Each additional . moves it up one additional level. E.g. ... would go three levels up. Optional Output Flags The method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default. -o out out specifies the destination to which to write the server's result to.

The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. .
