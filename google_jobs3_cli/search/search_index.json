By default all output is printed to standard out, but flags can be set to direct it into a file independent of your shell's capabilities. Errors will be printed to standard error, and cause the program's exit code to be non-zero. If data-structures are requested, these will be returned as pretty-printed JSON, to be useful as input to other tools. Everything else about the Cloud Talent Solution API can be found at the official documentation site . Installation and Source Code Install the command-line interface with cargo using: cargo install google-jobs3-cli Find the source code on github .

If unset, it defaults to the shortest scope url for a particular method. --config-dir <folder> A directory into which we will store our persistent data. Defaults to a user-writable directory that we will create during the first invocation. [default: ~/.google-service-cli] Configuration The program will store all persistent data in the ~/.google-service-cli directory in JSON files prefixed with jobs3- . You can change the directory used to store configuration with the --config-dir flag on a per-invocation basis. More information about the various kinds of persistent data are given in the following paragraphs. Authentication Most APIs require a user to authenticate any request. If this is the case, the scope determines the set of permissions granted. The granularity of these is usually no more than read-only or full-access . If not set, the system will automatically select the smallest feasible scope, e.g. when invoking a method that is read-only, it will ask only for a read-only scope. You may use the --scope flag to specify a scope directly. All applicable scopes are documented in the respective method's CLI documentation. The first time a scope is used, the user is asked for permission. Follow the instructions given by the CLI to grant permissions, or to decline. If a scope was authenticated by the user, the respective information will be stored as JSON in the configuration directory, e.g. ~/.google-service-cli/jobs3-token-<scope-hash>.json . No manual management of these tokens is necessary. To revoke granted authentication, please refer to the official documentation . Application Secrets In order to allow any application to use Google services, it will need to be registered using the Google Developer Console . APIs the application may use are then enabled for it one by one. Most APIs can be used for free and have a daily quota. To allow more comfortable usage of the CLI without forcing anyone to register an own application, the CLI comes with a default application secret that is configured accordingly. This also means that heavy usage all around the world may deplete the daily quota. You can workaround this limitation by putting your own secrets file at this location: ~/.google-service-cli/jobs3-secret.json , assuming that the required jobs API was enabled for it. Such a secret file can be downloaded in the Google Developer Console at APIs & auth -> Credentials -> Download JSON and used as is. Learn more about how to setup Google projects and enable APIs using the official documentation . Debugging Even though the CLI does its best to provide usable error messages, sometimes it might be desirable to know what exactly led to a particular issue. This is done by allowing all client-server communication to be output to standard error as-is . The --debug flag will print errors using the Debug representation to standard error. You may consider redirecting standard error into a file for ease of use, e.g. jobs3 --debug <resource> <method> [options] 2>debug.txt .","title":"Home"},{"location":"#installation-and-source-code","text":"Install the command-line interface with cargo using: cargo install google-jobs3-cli Find the source code on github .","title":"Installation and Source Code"},{"location":"#usage","text":"This documentation was generated from the Cloud Talent Solution API at revision 20240202 .

The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. .

Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time. -r .company career-site-uri=sed Optional. The URI to employer's career site or careers page on the employer's web site, for example, \"https://careers.google.com\". derived-info.headquarters-location.lat-lng latitude=0.7751996280578802 The latitude in degrees. It must be in the range [-90.0, +90.0]. longitude=0.3327893270828187 The longitude in degrees. It must be in the range [-180.0, +180.0]. .. location-type=duo The type of a location, which corresponds to the address lines field of PostalAddress. For example, \"Downtown, Atlanta, GA, USA\" has a type of LocationType#NEIGHBORHOOD, and \"Kansas City, KS, USA\" has a type of LocationType#LOCALITY. postal-address address-lines=ipsum Unstructured address lines describing the lower levels of an address. Because values in address_lines do not have type information and may sometimes contain multiple values in a single field (e.g. \"Austin, TX\"), it is important that the line order is clear. The order of address lines should be \"envelope order\" for the country/region of the address. In places where this can vary (e.g. Japan), address_language is used to make it explicit (e.g. \"ja\" for large-to-small ordering and \"ja-Latn\" or \"en\" for small-to-large). This way, the most specific line of an address can be selected based on the language. The minimum permitted structural representation of an address consists of a region_code with all remaining information placed in the address_lines. It would be possible to format such an address very approximately without geocoding, but no semantic reasoning could be made about any of the address components until it was at least partially resolved. Creating an address only containing a region_code and address_lines, and then geocoding is the recommended way to handle completely unstructured addresses (as opposed to guessing which parts of the address should be localities or administrative areas). Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. administrative-area=gubergren Optional. Highest administrative subdivision which is used for postal addresses of a country or region. For example, this can be a state, a province, an oblast, or a prefecture. Specifically, for Spain this is the province and not the autonomous community (e.g. \"Barcelona\" and not \"Catalonia\"). Many countries don't use an administrative area in postal addresses. E.g. in Switzerland this should be left unpopulated. language-code=lorem Optional. BCP-47 language code of the contents of this address (if known). This is often the UI language of the input form or is expected to match one of the languages used in the address' country/region, or their transliterated equivalents. This can affect formatting in certain countries, but is not critical to the correctness of the data and will never affect any validation or other non-formatting related operations. If this value is not known, it should be omitted (rather than specifying a possibly incorrect default). Examples: \"zh-Hant\", \"ja\", \"ja-Latn\", \"en\". locality=gubergren Optional. Generally refers to the city/town portion of the address. Examples: US city, IT comune, UK post town. In regions of the world where localities are not well defined or do not fit into this structure well, leave locality empty and use address_lines. organization=eos Optional. The name of the organization at the address. postal-code=dolor Optional. Postal code of the address. Not all countries use or require postal codes to be present, but where they are used, they may trigger additional validation with other parts of the address (e.g. state/zip validation in the U.S.A.). recipients=ea Optional. The recipient at the address. This field may, under certain circumstances, contain multiline information. For example, it might contain \"care of\" information. Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. region-code=ipsum Required. CLDR region code of the country/region of the address. This is never inferred and it is up to the user to ensure the value is correct. See https://cldr.unicode.org/ and https://www.unicode.org/cldr/charts/30/supplemental/territory_information.html for details. Example: \"CH\" for Switzerland. revision=13 The schema revision of the PostalAddress . This must be set to 0, which is the latest revision. All new revisions must be backward compatible with old revisions. sorting-code=amet Optional. Additional, country-specific, sorting code. This is not used in most regions. Where it is used, the value is either a string like \"CEDEX\", optionally followed by a number (e.g. \"CEDEX 7\"), or just a number alone, representing the \"sector code\" (Jamaica), \"delivery area indicator\" (Malawi) or \"post office indicator\" (e.g. C\u00f4te d'Ivoire). sublocality=duo Optional. Sublocality of the address. For example, this can be neighborhoods, boroughs, districts. .. radius-in-miles=0.39873905405496446 Radius in miles of the job location. This value is derived from the location bounding box in which a circle with the specified radius centered from LatLng covers the area associated with the job location. For example, currently, \"Mountain View, CA, USA\" has a radius of 6.17 miles. ... display-name=sed Required. The display name of the company, for example, \"Google LLC\". eeo-text=ut Optional. Equal Employment Opportunity legal disclaimer text to be associated with all jobs, and typically to be displayed in all roles. The maximum number of allowed characters is 500. external-id=gubergren Required. Client side company identifier, used to uniquely identify the company. The maximum number of allowed characters is 255. headquarters-address=rebum. Optional. The street address of the company's main headquarters, which may be different from the job location. The service attempts to geolocate the provided address, and populates a more specific location wherever possible in DerivedInfo.headquarters_location. hiring-agency=true Optional. Set to true if it is the hiring agency that post jobs for other employers. Defaults to false if not provided. image-uri=ipsum Optional. A URI that hosts the employer's company logo. keyword-searchable-job-custom-attributes=ipsum Optional. This field is deprecated. Please set the searchability of the custom attribute in the Job.custom_attributes going forward. A list of keys of filterable Job.custom_attributes, whose corresponding string_values are used in keyword search. Jobs with string_values under these specified field keys are returned if any of the values matches the search keyword. Custom field values with parenthesis, brackets and special symbols won't be properly searchable, and those keyword queries need to be surrounded by quotes. Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. name=est Required during company update. The resource name for a company. This is generated by the service when a company is created. The format is \"projects/{project_id}/companies/{company_id}\", for example, \"projects/api-test-project/companies/foo\". size=gubergren Optional. The employer's company size. suspended=false Output only. Indicates whether a company is flagged to be suspended from public availability by the service when job content appears suspicious, abusive, or spammy. website-uri=lorem Optional. The URI representing the company's primary web site or home page, for example, \"https://www.google.com\". The maximum number of allowed characters is 255.

It must be in the range [-180.0, +180.0]. .. location-type=duo The type of a location, which corresponds to the address lines field of PostalAddress. For example, \"Downtown, Atlanta, GA, USA\" has a type of LocationType#NEIGHBORHOOD, and \"Kansas City, KS, USA\" has a type of LocationType#LOCALITY. postal-address address-lines=ipsum Unstructured address lines describing the lower levels of an address. Because values in address_lines do not have type information and may sometimes contain multiple values in a single field (e.g. \"Austin, TX\"), it is important that the line order is clear. The order of address lines should be \"envelope order\" for the country/region of the address. In places where this can vary (e.g. Japan), address_language is used to make it explicit (e.g. \"ja\" for large-to-small ordering and \"ja-Latn\" or \"en\" for small-to-large). This way, the most specific line of an address can be selected based on the language. The minimum permitted structural representation of an address consists of a region_code with all remaining information placed in the address_lines. It would be possible to format such an address very approximately without geocoding, but no semantic reasoning could be made about any of the address components until it was at least partially resolved. Creating an address only containing a region_code and address_lines, and then geocoding is the recommended way to handle completely unstructured addresses (as opposed to guessing which parts of the address should be localities or administrative areas). Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. administrative-area=gubergren Optional. Highest administrative subdivision which is used for postal addresses of a country or region. For example, this can be a state, a province, an oblast, or a prefecture. Specifically, for Spain this is the province and not the autonomous community (e.g. \"Barcelona\" and not \"Catalonia\"). Many countries don't use an administrative area in postal addresses. E.g. in Switzerland this should be left unpopulated. language-code=lorem Optional. BCP-47 language code of the contents of this address (if known). This is often the UI language of the input form or is expected to match one of the languages used in the address' country/region, or their transliterated equivalents. This can affect formatting in certain countries, but is not critical to the correctness of the data and will never affect any validation or other non-formatting related operations. If this value is not known, it should be omitted (rather than specifying a possibly incorrect default). Examples: \"zh-Hant\", \"ja\", \"ja-Latn\", \"en\". locality=gubergren Optional. Generally refers to the city/town portion of the address. Examples: US city, IT comune, UK post town. In regions of the world where localities are not well defined or do not fit into this structure well, leave locality empty and use address_lines. organization=eos Optional. The name of the organization at the address. postal-code=dolor Optional. Postal code of the address. Not all countries use or require postal codes to be present, but where they are used, they may trigger additional validation with other parts of the address (e.g. state/zip validation in the U.S.A.). recipients=ea Optional. The recipient at the address. This field may, under certain circumstances, contain multiline information. For example, it might contain \"care of\" information. Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. region-code=ipsum Required. CLDR region code of the country/region of the address. This is never inferred and it is up to the user to ensure the value is correct. See https://cldr.unicode.org/ and https://www.unicode.org/cldr/charts/30/supplemental/territory_information.html for details. Example: \"CH\" for Switzerland. revision=13 The schema revision of the PostalAddress . This must be set to 0, which is the latest revision. All new revisions must be backward compatible with old revisions. sorting-code=amet Optional. Additional, country-specific, sorting code. This is not used in most regions. Where it is used, the value is either a string like \"CEDEX\", optionally followed by a number (e.g. \"CEDEX 7\"), or just a number alone, representing the \"sector code\" (Jamaica), \"delivery area indicator\" (Malawi) or \"post office indicator\" (e.g. C\u00f4te d'Ivoire). sublocality=duo Optional. Sublocality of the address. For example, this can be neighborhoods, boroughs, districts. .. radius-in-miles=0.39873905405496446 Radius in miles of the job location. This value is derived from the location bounding box in which a circle with the specified radius centered from LatLng covers the area associated with the job location. For example, currently, \"Mountain View, CA, USA\" has a radius of 6.17 miles. ... display-name=sed Required. The display name of the company, for example, \"Google LLC\". eeo-text=ut Optional. Equal Employment Opportunity legal disclaimer text to be associated with all jobs, and typically to be displayed in all roles. The maximum number of allowed characters is 500. external-id=gubergren Required. Client side company identifier, used to uniquely identify the company. The maximum number of allowed characters is 255. headquarters-address=rebum. Optional. The street address of the company's main headquarters, which may be different from the job location. The service attempts to geolocate the provided address, and populates a more specific location wherever possible in DerivedInfo.headquarters_location. hiring-agency=true Optional. Set to true if it is the hiring agency that post jobs for other employers. Defaults to false if not provided. image-uri=ipsum Optional. A URI that hosts the employer's company logo. keyword-searchable-job-custom-attributes=ipsum Optional. This field is deprecated.

A list of keys of filterable Job.custom_attributes, whose corresponding string_values are used in keyword search. Jobs with string_values under these specified field keys are returned if any of the values matches the search keyword.

The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. . Each additional . moves it up one additional level. E.g. ... would go three levels up. Optional Output Flags The method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default. -o out out specifies the destination to which to write the server's result to.

Each field may be a simple scalar or another data-structure. In the latter case it is advised to set the field-cursor to the data-structure's field to specify values more concisely. For example, a structure like this: UpdateCompanyRequest: company: career-site-uri: string derived-info: headquarters-location: lat-lng: latitude: number longitude: number location-type: string postal-address: address-lines: [string] administrative-area: string language-code: string locality: string organization: string postal-code: string recipients: [string] region-code: string revision: integer sorting-code: string sublocality: string radius-in-miles: number display-name: string eeo-text: string external-id: string headquarters-address: string hiring-agency: boolean image-uri: string keyword-searchable-job-custom-attributes: [string] name: string size: string suspended: boolean website-uri: string update-mask: string can be set completely with the following arguments which are assumed to be executed in the given order. Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time. -r .company career-site-uri=eos Optional. The URI to employer's career site or careers page on the employer's web site, for example, \"https://careers.google.com\". derived-info.headquarters-location.lat-lng latitude=0.11853734747270994 The latitude in degrees. It must be in the range [-90.0, +90.0]. longitude=0.24638057468506236 The longitude in degrees. It must be in the range [-180.0, +180.0]. .. location-type=sed The type of a location, which corresponds to the address lines field of PostalAddress. For example, \"Downtown, Atlanta, GA, USA\" has a type of LocationType#NEIGHBORHOOD, and \"Kansas City, KS, USA\" has a type of LocationType#LOCALITY. postal-address address-lines=no Unstructured address lines describing the lower levels of an address. Because values in address_lines do not have type information and may sometimes contain multiple values in a single field (e.g. \"Austin, TX\"), it is important that the line order is clear. The order of address lines should be \"envelope order\" for the country/region of the address. In places where this can vary (e.g. Japan), address_language is used to make it explicit (e.g. \"ja\" for large-to-small ordering and \"ja-Latn\" or \"en\" for small-to-large). This way, the most specific line of an address can be selected based on the language. The minimum permitted structural representation of an address consists of a region_code with all remaining information placed in the address_lines. It would be possible to format such an address very approximately without geocoding, but no semantic reasoning could be made about any of the address components until it was at least partially resolved. Creating an address only containing a region_code and address_lines, and then geocoding is the recommended way to handle completely unstructured addresses (as opposed to guessing which parts of the address should be localities or administrative areas). Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. administrative-area=stet Optional. Highest administrative subdivision which is used for postal addresses of a country or region. For example, this can be a state, a province, an oblast, or a prefecture. Specifically, for Spain this is the province and not the autonomous community (e.g. \"Barcelona\" and not \"Catalonia\"). Many countries don't use an administrative area in postal addresses. E.g. in Switzerland this should be left unpopulated. language-code=kasd Optional. BCP-47 language code of the contents of this address (if known). This is often the UI language of the input form or is expected to match one of the languages used in the address' country/region, or their transliterated equivalents. This can affect formatting in certain countries, but is not critical to the correctness of the data and will never affect any validation or other non-formatting related operations. If this value is not known, it should be omitted (rather than specifying a possibly incorrect default). Examples: \"zh-Hant\", \"ja\", \"ja-Latn\", \"en\". locality=et Optional. Generally refers to the city/town portion of the address. Examples: US city, IT comune, UK post town. In regions of the world where localities are not well defined or do not fit into this structure well, leave locality empty and use address_lines. organization=sed Optional. The name of the organization at the address. postal-code=et Optional. Postal code of the address. Not all countries use or require postal codes to be present, but where they are used, they may trigger additional validation with other parts of the address (e.g. state/zip validation in the U.S.A.). recipients=et Optional. The recipient at the address. This field may, under certain circumstances, contain multiline information. For example, it might contain \"care of\" information. Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. region-code=vero Required. CLDR region code of the country/region of the address. This is never inferred and it is up to the user to ensure the value is correct. See https://cldr.unicode.org/ and https://www.unicode.org/cldr/charts/30/supplemental/territory_information.html for details. Example: \"CH\" for Switzerland. revision=70 The schema revision of the PostalAddress . This must be set to 0, which is the latest revision. All new revisions must be backward compatible with old revisions. sorting-code=sed Optional. Additional, country-specific, sorting code. This is not used in most regions. Where it is used, the value is either a string like \"CEDEX\", optionally followed by a number (e.g. \"CEDEX 7\"), or just a number alone, representing the \"sector code\" (Jamaica), \"delivery area indicator\" (Malawi) or \"post office indicator\" (e.g. C\u00f4te d'Ivoire). sublocality=duo Optional. Sublocality of the address. For example, this can be neighborhoods, boroughs, districts. .. radius-in-miles=0.5254434270373415 Radius in miles of the job location. This value is derived from the location bounding box in which a circle with the specified radius centered from LatLng covers the area associated with the job location. For example, currently, \"Mountain View, CA, USA\" has a radius of 6.17 miles. ... display-name=et Required. The display name of the company, for example, \"Google LLC\". eeo-text=voluptua. Optional. Equal Employment Opportunity legal disclaimer text to be associated with all jobs, and typically to be displayed in all roles. The maximum number of allowed characters is 500. external-id=amet. Required. Client side company identifier, used to uniquely identify the company. The maximum number of allowed characters is 255. headquarters-address=consetetur Optional. The street address of the company's main headquarters, which may be different from the job location. The service attempts to geolocate the provided address, and populates a more specific location wherever possible in DerivedInfo.headquarters_location. hiring-agency=false Optional. Set to true if it is the hiring agency that post jobs for other employers. Defaults to false if not provided. image-uri=dolor Optional. A URI that hosts the employer's company logo. keyword-searchable-job-custom-attributes=et Optional. This field is deprecated. Please set the searchability of the custom attribute in the Job.custom_attributes going forward. A list of keys of filterable Job.custom_attributes, whose corresponding string_values are used in keyword search. Jobs with string_values under these specified field keys are returned if any of the values matches the search keyword. Custom field values with parenthesis, brackets and special symbols won't be properly searchable, and those keyword queries need to be surrounded by quotes. Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. name=et Required during company update. The resource name for a company. This is generated by the service when a company is created. The format is \"projects/{project_id}/companies/{company_id}\", for example, \"projects/api-test-project/companies/foo\". size=sadipscing Optional. The employer's company size. suspended=false Output only. Indicates whether a company is flagged to be suspended from public availability by the service when job content appears suspicious, abusive, or spammy. website-uri=duo Optional. The URI representing the company's primary web site or home page, for example, \"https://www.google.com\".

If a job has more locations, it is suggested to split it into multiple jobs with unique requisition_ids (e.g. 'ReqA' becomes 'ReqA-1', 'ReqA-2', etc.) as multiple jobs with the same company_name, language_code and requisition_id are not allowed. If the original requisition_id must be preserved, a custom field should be used for storage. It is also suggested to group the locations that close to each other in the same job for better search experience. Jobs with multiple addresses must have their addresses with the same LocationType to allow location filtering to work properly. (For example, a Job with addresses \"1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA, USA\" and \"London, UK\" may not have location filters applied correctly at search time since the first is a LocationType.STREET_ADDRESS and the second is a LocationType.LOCALITY.) If a job needs to have multiple addresses, it is suggested to split it into multiple jobs with same LocationTypes. The maximum number of allowed characters is 500.

Invalid timestamps are ignored. job-level=voluptua. Optional. The experience level associated with the job, such as \"Entry Level\". job-start-time=amet. Optional. The start timestamp of the job in UTC time zone. Typically this field is used for contracting engagements. Invalid timestamps are ignored. language-code=ea Optional. The language of the posting. This field is distinct from any requirements for fluency that are associated with the job. Language codes must be in BCP-47 format, such as \"en-US\" or \"sr-Latn\". For more information, see Tags for Identifying Languages {: class=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" }. If this field is unspecified and Job.description is present, detected language code based on Job.description is assigned, otherwise defaults to 'en_US'. name=sadipscing Required during job update. The resource name for the job. This is generated by the service when a job is created. The format is \"projects/{project_id}/jobs/{job_id}\", for example, \"projects/api-test-project/jobs/1234\". Use of this field in job queries and API calls is preferred over the use of requisition_id since this value is unique. posting-create-time=lorem Output only. The timestamp when this job posting was created. posting-expire-time=invidunt Optional but strongly recommended for the best service experience. The expiration timestamp of the job. After this timestamp, the job is marked as expired, and it no longer appears in search results. The expired job can't be deleted or listed by the DeleteJob and ListJobs APIs, but it can be retrieved with the GetJob API or updated with the UpdateJob API. An expired job can be updated and opened again by using a future expiration timestamp. Updating an expired job fails if there is another existing open job with same company_name, language_code and requisition_id. The expired jobs are retained in our system for 90 days. However, the overall expired job count cannot exceed 3 times the maximum of open jobs count over the past week, otherwise jobs with earlier expire time are cleaned first. Expired jobs are no longer accessible after they are cleaned out. Invalid timestamps are ignored, and treated as expire time not provided. Timestamp before the instant request is made is considered valid, the job will be treated as expired immediately. If this value is not provided at the time of job creation or is invalid, the job posting expires after 30 days from the job's creation time. For example, if the job was created on 2017/01/01 13:00AM UTC with an unspecified expiration date, the job expires after 2017/01/31 13:00AM UTC. If this value is not provided on job update, it depends on the field masks set by UpdateJobRequest.update_mask. If the field masks include expiry_time, or the masks are empty meaning that every field is updated, the job posting expires after 30 days from the job's last update time. Otherwise the expiration date isn't updated. posting-publish-time=no Optional. The timestamp this job posting was most recently published. The default value is the time the request arrives at the server. Invalid timestamps are ignored. posting-region=est Optional. The job PostingRegion (for example, state, country) throughout which the job is available. If this field is set, a LocationFilter in a search query within the job region finds this job posting if an exact location match isn't specified. If this field is set to PostingRegion.NATION or PostingRegion.ADMINISTRATIVE_AREA, setting job Job.addresses to the same location level as this field is strongly recommended. posting-update-time=at Output only. The timestamp when this job posting was last updated. processing-options disable-street-address-resolution=true Optional.

Defaults to HtmlSanitization.SIMPLE_FORMATTING_ONLY. .. promotion-value=66 Optional. A promotion value of the job, as determined by the client. The value determines the sort order of the jobs returned when searching for jobs using the featured jobs search call, with higher promotional values being returned first and ties being resolved by relevance sort. Only the jobs with a promotionValue >0 are returned in a FEATURED_JOB_SEARCH. Default value is 0, and negative values are treated as 0. qualifications=tempor Optional. A description of the qualifications required to perform the job. The use of this field is recommended as an alternative to using the more general description field.

The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. . Each additional . moves it up one additional level. E.g. ... would go three levels up.

You can set the scope for this method like this: jobs3 --scope <scope> projects jobs-patch ... Required Scalar Argument <name> (string) Required during job update. The resource name for the job. This is generated by the service when a job is created. The format is \"projects/{project_id}/jobs/{job_id}\", for example, \"projects/api-test-project/jobs/1234\". Use of this field in job queries and API calls is preferred over the use of requisition_id since this value is unique. Required Request Value The request value is a data-structure with various fields. Each field may be a simple scalar or another data-structure. In the latter case it is advised to set the field-cursor to the data-structure's field to specify values more concisely. For example, a structure like this: UpdateJobRequest: job: addresses: [string] application-info: emails: [string] instruction: string uris: [string] company-display-name: string company-name: string compensation-info: annualized-base-compensation-range: max-compensation: currency-code: string nanos: integer units: string min-compensation: currency-code: string nanos: integer units: string annualized-total-compensation-range: max-compensation: currency-code: string nanos: integer units: string min-compensation: currency-code: string nanos: integer units: string degree-types: [string] department: string derived-info: job-categories: [string] description: string employment-types: [string] incentives: string job-benefits: [string] job-end-time: string job-level: string job-start-time: string language-code: string name: string posting-create-time: string posting-expire-time: string posting-publish-time: string posting-region: string posting-update-time: string processing-options: disable-street-address-resolution: boolean html-sanitization: string promotion-value: integer qualifications: string requisition-id: string responsibilities: string title: string visibility: string update-mask: string can be set completely with the following arguments which are assumed to be executed in the given order. Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time. -r .job addresses=lorem Optional but strongly recommended for the best service experience. Location(s) where the employer is looking to hire for this job posting. Specifying the full street address(es) of the hiring location enables better API results, especially job searches by commute time. At most 50 locations are allowed for best search performance. If a job has more locations, it is suggested to split it into multiple jobs with unique requisition_ids (e.g. 'ReqA' becomes 'ReqA-1', 'ReqA-2', etc.) as multiple jobs with the same company_name, language_code and requisition_id are not allowed. If the original requisition_id must be preserved, a custom field should be used for storage. It is also suggested to group the locations that close to each other in the same job for better search experience. Jobs with multiple addresses must have their addresses with the same LocationType to allow location filtering to work properly. (For example, a Job with addresses \"1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA, USA\" and \"London, UK\" may not have location filters applied correctly at search time since the first is a LocationType.STREET_ADDRESS and the second is a LocationType.LOCALITY.) If a job needs to have multiple addresses, it is suggested to split it into multiple jobs with same LocationTypes. The maximum number of allowed characters is 500. Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. application-info emails=est Optional but at least one of uris, emails or instruction must be specified. Use this field to specify email address(es) to which resumes or applications can be sent. The maximum number of allowed characters for each entry is 255.

Use this field to provide instructions, such as \"Mail your application to ...\", that a candidate can follow to apply for the job. This field accepts and sanitizes HTML input, and also accepts bold, italic, ordered list, and unordered list markup tags. The maximum number of allowed characters is 3,000. uris=diam Optional but at least one of uris, emails or instruction must be specified. Use this URI field to direct an applicant to a website, for example to link to an online application form. The maximum number of allowed characters for each entry is 2,000. Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. .. company-display-name=dolores Output only. Display name of the company listing the job. company-name=dolores Required.

Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. department=erat Optional. The department or functional area within the company with the open position. The maximum number of allowed characters is 255. derived-info job-categories=aliquyam Job categories derived from Job.title and Job.description. Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. .. description=amet Required. The description of the job, which typically includes a multi-paragraph description of the company and related information. Separate fields are provided on the job object for responsibilities, qualifications, and other job characteristics. Use of these separate job fields is recommended. This field accepts and sanitizes HTML input, and also accepts bold, italic, ordered list, and unordered list markup tags. The maximum number of allowed characters is 100,000. employment-types=est Optional. The employment type(s) of a job, for example, full time or part time. Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. incentives=et Optional. A description of bonus, commission, and other compensation incentives associated with the job not including salary or pay. The maximum number of allowed characters is 10,000. job-benefits=sea Optional. The benefits included with the job. Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. job-end-time=consetetur Optional. The end timestamp of the job. Typically this field is used for contracting engagements. Invalid timestamps are ignored. job-level=consetetur Optional. The experience level associated with the job, such as \"Entry Level\". job-start-time=stet Optional. The start timestamp of the job in UTC time zone. Typically this field is used for contracting engagements. Invalid timestamps are ignored. language-code=est Optional. The language of the posting. This field is distinct from any requirements for fluency that are associated with the job. Language codes must be in BCP-47 format, such as \"en-US\" or \"sr-Latn\". For more information, see Tags for Identifying Languages {: class=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" }. If this field is unspecified and Job.description is present, detected language code based on Job.description is assigned, otherwise defaults to 'en_US'. name=aliquyam Required during job update. The resource name for the job. This is generated by the service when a job is created. The format is \"projects/{project_id}/jobs/{job_id}\", for example, \"projects/api-test-project/jobs/1234\". Use of this field in job queries and API calls is preferred over the use of requisition_id since this value is unique. posting-create-time=elitr Output only. The timestamp when this job posting was created. posting-expire-time=duo Optional but strongly recommended for the best service experience. The expiration timestamp of the job. After this timestamp, the job is marked as expired, and it no longer appears in search results. The expired job can't be deleted or listed by the DeleteJob and ListJobs APIs, but it can be retrieved with the GetJob API or updated with the UpdateJob API. An expired job can be updated and opened again by using a future expiration timestamp. Updating an expired job fails if there is another existing open job with same company_name, language_code and requisition_id. The expired jobs are retained in our system for 90 days. However, the overall expired job count cannot exceed 3 times the maximum of open jobs count over the past week, otherwise jobs with earlier expire time are cleaned first. Expired jobs are no longer accessible after they are cleaned out. Invalid timestamps are ignored, and treated as expire time not provided. Timestamp before the instant request is made is considered valid, the job will be treated as expired immediately. If this value is not provided at the time of job creation or is invalid, the job posting expires after 30 days from the job's creation time. For example, if the job was created on 2017/01/01 13:00AM UTC with an unspecified expiration date, the job expires after 2017/01/31 13:00AM UTC. If this value is not provided on job update, it depends on the field masks set by UpdateJobRequest.update_mask. If the field masks include expiry_time, or the masks are empty meaning that every field is updated, the job posting expires after 30 days from the job's last update time. Otherwise the expiration date isn't updated. posting-publish-time=diam Optional. The timestamp this job posting was most recently published. The default value is the time the request arrives at the server. Invalid timestamps are ignored. posting-region=est Optional. The job PostingRegion (for example, state, country) throughout which the job is available. If this field is set, a LocationFilter in a search query within the job region finds this job posting if an exact location match isn't specified. If this field is set to PostingRegion.NATION or PostingRegion.ADMINISTRATIVE_AREA, setting job Job.addresses to the same location level as this field is strongly recommended. posting-update-time=sit Output only. The timestamp when this job posting was last updated. processing-options disable-street-address-resolution=false Optional. If set to true , the service does not attempt to resolve a more precise address for the job. html-sanitization=eos Optional. Option for job HTML content sanitization. Applied fields are: * description * applicationInfo.instruction * incentives * qualifications * responsibilities HTML tags in these fields may be stripped if sanitiazation is not disabled. Defaults to HtmlSanitization.SIMPLE_FORMATTING_ONLY. .. promotion-value=45 Optional. A promotion value of the job, as determined by the client. The value determines the sort order of the jobs returned when searching for jobs using the featured jobs search call, with higher promotional values being returned first and ties being resolved by relevance sort. Only the jobs with a promotionValue >0 are returned in a FEATURED_JOB_SEARCH. Default value is 0, and negative values are treated as 0. qualifications=ea Optional. A description of the qualifications required to perform the job. The use of this field is recommended as an alternative to using the more general description field. This field accepts and sanitizes HTML input, and also accepts bold, italic, ordered list, and unordered list markup tags. The maximum number of allowed characters is 10,000. requisition-id=stet Required. The requisition ID, also referred to as the posting ID, assigned by the client to identify a job. This field is intended to be used by clients for client identification and tracking of postings. A job is not allowed to be created if there is another job with the same [company_name], language_code and requisition_id. The maximum number of allowed characters is 255. responsibilities=dolores Optional. A description of job responsibilities. The use of this field is recommended as an alternative to using the more general description field. This field accepts and sanitizes HTML input, and also accepts bold, italic, ordered list, and unordered list markup tags. The maximum number of allowed characters is 10,000. title=eos Required. The title of the job, such as \"Software Engineer\" The maximum number of allowed characters is 500. visibility=et Deprecated. The job is only visible to the owner. The visibility of the job. Defaults to Visibility.ACCOUNT_ONLY if not specified. .. update-mask=sea Optional but strongly recommended to be provided for the best service experience. If update_mask is provided, only the specified fields in job are updated. Otherwise all the fields are updated. A field mask to restrict the fields that are updated. Only top level fields of Job are supported. About Cursors The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. . Each additional . moves it up one additional level. E.g. ... would go three levels up. Optional Output Flags The method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default. -o out out specifies the destination to which to write the server's result to.

Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time. -r .job addresses=lorem Optional but strongly recommended for the best service experience. Location(s) where the employer is looking to hire for this job posting. Specifying the full street address(es) of the hiring location enables better API results, especially job searches by commute time. At most 50 locations are allowed for best search performance. If a job has more locations, it is suggested to split it into multiple jobs with unique requisition_ids (e.g. 'ReqA' becomes 'ReqA-1', 'ReqA-2', etc.) as multiple jobs with the same company_name, language_code and requisition_id are not allowed. If the original requisition_id must be preserved, a custom field should be used for storage. It is also suggested to group the locations that close to each other in the same job for better search experience. Jobs with multiple addresses must have their addresses with the same LocationType to allow location filtering to work properly. (For example, a Job with addresses \"1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA, USA\" and \"London, UK\" may not have location filters applied correctly at search time since the first is a LocationType.STREET_ADDRESS and the second is a LocationType.LOCALITY.) If a job needs to have multiple addresses, it is suggested to split it into multiple jobs with same LocationTypes. The maximum number of allowed characters is 500. Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. application-info emails=est Optional but at least one of uris, emails or instruction must be specified.

Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. department=erat Optional. The department or functional area within the company with the open position. The maximum number of allowed characters is 255. derived-info job-categories=aliquyam Job categories derived from Job.title and Job.description. Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. .. description=amet Required. The description of the job, which typically includes a multi-paragraph description of the company and related information. Separate fields are provided on the job object for responsibilities, qualifications, and other job characteristics. Use of these separate job fields is recommended. This field accepts and sanitizes HTML input, and also accepts bold, italic, ordered list, and unordered list markup tags. The maximum number of allowed characters is 100,000. employment-types=est Optional. The employment type(s) of a job, for example, full time or part time. Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. incentives=et Optional. A description of bonus, commission, and other compensation incentives associated with the job not including salary or pay. The maximum number of allowed characters is 10,000. job-benefits=sea Optional. The benefits included with the job. Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. job-end-time=consetetur Optional. The end timestamp of the job. Typically this field is used for contracting engagements. Invalid timestamps are ignored. job-level=consetetur Optional. The experience level associated with the job, such as \"Entry Level\". job-start-time=stet Optional. The start timestamp of the job in UTC time zone. Typically this field is used for contracting engagements. Invalid timestamps are ignored. language-code=est Optional. The language of the posting. This field is distinct from any requirements for fluency that are associated with the job. Language codes must be in BCP-47 format, such as \"en-US\" or \"sr-Latn\". For more information, see Tags for Identifying Languages {: class=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" }. If this field is unspecified and Job.description is present, detected language code based on Job.description is assigned, otherwise defaults to 'en_US'. name=aliquyam Required during job update. The resource name for the job. This is generated by the service when a job is created. The format is \"projects/{project_id}/jobs/{job_id}\", for example, \"projects/api-test-project/jobs/1234\". Use of this field in job queries and API calls is preferred over the use of requisition_id since this value is unique. posting-create-time=elitr Output only. The timestamp when this job posting was created. posting-expire-time=duo Optional but strongly recommended for the best service experience. The expiration timestamp of the job. After this timestamp, the job is marked as expired, and it no longer appears in search results. The expired job can't be deleted or listed by the DeleteJob and ListJobs APIs, but it can be retrieved with the GetJob API or updated with the UpdateJob API. An expired job can be updated and opened again by using a future expiration timestamp. Updating an expired job fails if there is another existing open job with same company_name, language_code and requisition_id. The expired jobs are retained in our system for 90 days. However, the overall expired job count cannot exceed 3 times the maximum of open jobs count over the past week, otherwise jobs with earlier expire time are cleaned first. Expired jobs are no longer accessible after they are cleaned out. Invalid timestamps are ignored, and treated as expire time not provided. Timestamp before the instant request is made is considered valid, the job will be treated as expired immediately. If this value is not provided at the time of job creation or is invalid, the job posting expires after 30 days from the job's creation time. For example, if the job was created on 2017/01/01 13:00AM UTC with an unspecified expiration date, the job expires after 2017/01/31 13:00AM UTC. If this value is not provided on job update, it depends on the field masks set by UpdateJobRequest.update_mask. If the field masks include expiry_time, or the masks are empty meaning that every field is updated, the job posting expires after 30 days from the job's last update time. Otherwise the expiration date isn't updated. posting-publish-time=diam Optional. The timestamp this job posting was most recently published. The default value is the time the request arrives at the server. Invalid timestamps are ignored. posting-region=est Optional. The job PostingRegion (for example, state, country) throughout which the job is available. If this field is set, a LocationFilter in a search query within the job region finds this job posting if an exact location match isn't specified. If this field is set to PostingRegion.NATION or PostingRegion.ADMINISTRATIVE_AREA, setting job Job.addresses to the same location level as this field is strongly recommended. posting-update-time=sit Output only. The timestamp when this job posting was last updated. processing-options disable-street-address-resolution=false Optional. If set to true , the service does not attempt to resolve a more precise address for the job. html-sanitization=eos Optional. Option for job HTML content sanitization. Applied fields are: * description * applicationInfo.instruction * incentives * qualifications * responsibilities HTML tags in these fields may be stripped if sanitiazation is not disabled. Defaults to HtmlSanitization.SIMPLE_FORMATTING_ONLY. .. promotion-value=45 Optional. A promotion value of the job, as determined by the client. The value determines the sort order of the jobs returned when searching for jobs using the featured jobs search call, with higher promotional values being returned first and ties being resolved by relevance sort. Only the jobs with a promotionValue >0 are returned in a FEATURED_JOB_SEARCH. Default value is 0, and negative values are treated as 0. qualifications=ea Optional. A description of the qualifications required to perform the job. The use of this field is recommended as an alternative to using the more general description field. This field accepts and sanitizes HTML input, and also accepts bold, italic, ordered list, and unordered list markup tags. The maximum number of allowed characters is 10,000. requisition-id=stet Required. The requisition ID, also referred to as the posting ID, assigned by the client to identify a job. This field is intended to be used by clients for client identification and tracking of postings. A job is not allowed to be created if there is another job with the same [company_name], language_code and requisition_id. The maximum number of allowed characters is 255. responsibilities=dolores Optional. A description of job responsibilities. The use of this field is recommended as an alternative to using the more general description field.

Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time. -r . disable-keyword-match=false Optional. Controls whether to disable exact keyword match on Job.job_title, Job.description, Job.company_display_name, Job.locations, Job.qualifications. When disable keyword match is turned off, a keyword match returns jobs that do not match given category filters when there are matching keywords. For example, the query \"program manager,\" a result is returned even if the job posting has the title \"software developer,\" which does not fall into \"program manager\" ontology, but does have \"program manager\" appearing in its description. For queries like \"cloud\" that does not contain title or location specific ontology, jobs with \"cloud\" keyword matches are returned regardless of this flag's value. Please use Company.keyword_searchable_custom_fields or Company.keyword_searchable_custom_attributes if company specific globally matched custom field/attribute string values is needed. Enabling keyword match improves recall of subsequent search requests. Defaults to false. diversification-level=amet. Optional. Controls whether highly similar jobs are returned next to each other in the search results. Jobs are identified as highly similar based on their titles, job categories, and locations. Highly similar results are clustered so that only one representative job of the cluster is displayed to the job seeker higher up in the results, with the other jobs being displayed lower down in the results. Defaults to DiversificationLevel.SIMPLE if no value is specified. enable-broadening=false Optional. Controls whether to broaden the search when it produces sparse results. Broadened queries append results to the end of the matching results list. Defaults to false. histogram-facets simple-histogram-facets=sed Optional. Specifies the simple type of histogram facets, for example, COMPANY_SIZE , EMPLOYMENT_TYPE etc. Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. ..job-query.commute-filter allow-imprecise-addresses=false Optional. If true, jobs without \"precise\" addresses (street level addresses or GPS coordinates) might also be returned. For city and coarser level addresses, text matching is used. If this field is set to false or is not specified, only jobs that include precise addresses are returned by Commute Search. Note: If allow_imprecise_addresses is set to true, Commute Search is not able to calculate accurate commute times to jobs with city level and coarser address information. Jobs with imprecise addresses will return a travel_duration time of 0 regardless of distance from the job seeker. commute-method=sanctus Required. The method of transportation for which to calculate the commute time. departure-time hours=10 Hours of day in 24 hour format. Should be from 0 to 23.

This filter specifies the company Company.display_name of the jobs to search against. The company name must match the value exactly. Alternatively, the value being searched for can be wrapped in different match operators. SUBSTRING_MATCH([value]) The company name must contain a case insensitive substring match of the value. Using this function may increase latency. Sample Value: SUBSTRING_MATCH(google) MULTI_WORD_TOKEN_MATCH([value]) The value will be treated as a multi word token and the company name must contain a case insensitive match of the value. Using this function may increase latency. Sample Value: MULTI_WORD_TOKEN_MATCH(google) If a value isn't specified, jobs within the search results are associated with any company. If multiple values are specified, jobs within the search results may be associated with any of the specified companies. At most 20 company display name filters are allowed.

If a value is not specified, jobs in the search results includes any employment type. If multiple values are specified, jobs in the search results include any of the specified employment types. Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. job-categories=magna Optional. The category filter specifies the categories of jobs to search against. See Category for more information. If a value is not specified, jobs from any category are searched against. If multiple values are specified, jobs from any of the specified categories are searched against. Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. language-codes=takimata Optional. This filter specifies the locale of jobs to search against, for example, \"en-US\". If a value isn't specified, the search results can contain jobs in any locale. Language codes should be in BCP-47 format, such as \"en-US\" or \"sr-Latn\". For more information, see Tags for Identifying Languages . At most 10 language code filters are allowed.

The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. . Each additional . moves it up one additional level. E.g. ... would go three levels up. Optional Output Flags The method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default. -o out out specifies the destination to which to write the server's result to. It will be a JSON-encoded structure. The destination may be - to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes. If unset, it defaults to standard output.

Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time. -r . disable-keyword-match=false Optional. Controls whether to disable exact keyword match on Job.job_title, Job.description, Job.company_display_name, Job.locations, Job.qualifications. When disable keyword match is turned off, a keyword match returns jobs that do not match given category filters when there are matching keywords. For example, the query \"program manager,\" a result is returned even if the job posting has the title \"software developer,\" which does not fall into \"program manager\" ontology, but does have \"program manager\" appearing in its description. For queries like \"cloud\" that does not contain title or location specific ontology, jobs with \"cloud\" keyword matches are returned regardless of this flag's value. Please use Company.keyword_searchable_custom_fields or Company.keyword_searchable_custom_attributes if company specific globally matched custom field/attribute string values is needed. Enabling keyword match improves recall of subsequent search requests. Defaults to false. diversification-level=amet. Optional. Controls whether highly similar jobs are returned next to each other in the search results. Jobs are identified as highly similar based on their titles, job categories, and locations. Highly similar results are clustered so that only one representative job of the cluster is displayed to the job seeker higher up in the results, with the other jobs being displayed lower down in the results. Defaults to DiversificationLevel.SIMPLE if no value is specified. enable-broadening=false Optional. Controls whether to broaden the search when it produces sparse results. Broadened queries append results to the end of the matching results list. Defaults to false. histogram-facets simple-histogram-facets=sed Optional.

The desired job attributes returned for jobs in the search response. Defaults to JobView.SMALL if no value is specified. offset=45 Optional. An integer that specifies the current offset (that is, starting result location, amongst the jobs deemed by the API as relevant) in search results. This field is only considered if page_token is unset. The maximum allowed value is 5000. Otherwise an error is thrown. For example, 0 means to return results starting from the first matching job, and 10 means to return from the 11th job. This can be used for pagination, (for example, pageSize = 10 and offset = 10 means to return from the second page). order-by=accusam Optional. The criteria determining how search results are sorted. Default is \"relevance desc\". Supported options are: * &#34;relevance desc&#34; : By relevance descending, as determined by the API algorithms. Relevance thresholding of query results is only available with this ordering. * &#34;posting_publish_time desc&#34; : By Job.posting_publish_time descending. * &#34;posting_update_time desc&#34; : By Job.posting_update_time descending. * &#34;title&#34; : By Job.title ascending. * &#34;title desc&#34; : By Job.title descending. * &#34;annualized_base_compensation&#34; : By job's CompensationInfo.annualized_base_compensation_range ascending.

The maximum number of allowed characters is 255. user-id=magna Required. A unique user identification string, as determined by the client. To have the strongest positive impact on search quality make sure the client-level is unique. Obfuscate this field for privacy concerns before providing it to the service. If this field is not available for some reason, send \"UNKNOWN\". Note that any improvements to the model for a particular tenant site, rely on this field being set correctly to a unique user_id. The maximum number of allowed characters is 255. .. require-precise-result-size=true This field is deprecated. search-mode=dolor Optional. Mode of a search. Defaults to SearchMode.JOB_SEARCH. About Cursors The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures.

The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. . Each additional . moves it up one additional level. E.g. ... would go three levels up. Optional Output Flags The method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default. -o out out specifies the destination to which to write the server's result to. It will be a JSON-encoded structure. The destination may be - to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes. If unset, it defaults to standard output.

Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time. -r . disable-keyword-match=false Optional. Controls whether to disable exact keyword match on Job.job_title, Job.description, Job.company_display_name, Job.locations, Job.qualifications. When disable keyword match is turned off, a keyword match returns jobs that do not match given category filters when there are matching keywords. For example, the query \"program manager,\" a result is returned even if the job posting has the title \"software developer,\" which does not fall into \"program manager\" ontology, but does have \"program manager\" appearing in its description. For queries like \"cloud\" that does not contain title or location specific ontology, jobs with \"cloud\" keyword matches are returned regardless of this flag's value. Please use Company.keyword_searchable_custom_fields or Company.keyword_searchable_custom_attributes if company specific globally matched custom field/attribute string values is needed. Enabling keyword match improves recall of subsequent search requests. Defaults to false. diversification-level=at Optional. Controls whether highly similar jobs are returned next to each other in the search results. Jobs are identified as highly similar based on their titles, job categories, and locations. Highly similar results are clustered so that only one representative job of the cluster is displayed to the job seeker higher up in the results, with the other jobs being displayed lower down in the results. Defaults to DiversificationLevel.SIMPLE if no value is specified. enable-broadening=false Optional. Controls whether to broaden the search when it produces sparse results. Broadened queries append results to the end of the matching results list. Defaults to false. histogram-facets simple-histogram-facets=eirmod Optional.

If true, jobs without \"precise\" addresses (street level addresses or GPS coordinates) might also be returned. For city and coarser level addresses, text matching is used. If this field is set to false or is not specified, only jobs that include precise addresses are returned by Commute Search. Note: If allow_imprecise_addresses is set to true, Commute Search is not able to calculate accurate commute times to jobs with city level and coarser address information. Jobs with imprecise addresses will return a travel_duration time of 0 regardless of distance from the job seeker. commute-method=accusam Required. The method of transportation for which to calculate the commute time. departure-time hours=54 Hours of day in 24 hour format. Should be from 0 to 23.

This filter specifies the company Company.display_name of the jobs to search against. The company name must match the value exactly. Alternatively, the value being searched for can be wrapped in different match operators. SUBSTRING_MATCH([value]) The company name must contain a case insensitive substring match of the value. Using this function may increase latency. Sample Value: SUBSTRING_MATCH(google) MULTI_WORD_TOKEN_MATCH([value]) The value will be treated as a multi word token and the company name must contain a case insensitive match of the value. Using this function may increase latency. Sample Value: MULTI_WORD_TOKEN_MATCH(google) If a value isn't specified, jobs within the search results are associated with any company. If multiple values are specified, jobs within the search results may be associated with any of the specified companies. At most 20 company display name filters are allowed.
