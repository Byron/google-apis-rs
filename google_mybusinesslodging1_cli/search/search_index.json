By default all output is printed to standard out, but flags can be set to direct it into a file independent of your shell's capabilities. Errors will be printed to standard error, and cause the program's exit code to be non-zero. If data-structures are requested, these will be returned as pretty-printed JSON, to be useful as input to other tools. Everything else about the My Business Lodging API can be found at the official documentation site . Installation and Source Code Install the command-line interface with cargo using: cargo install google-mybusinesslodging1-cli Find the source code on github . Usage This documentation was generated from the My Business Lodging API at revision 20240304 . The CLI is at version 5.0.4 . mybusinesslodging1 [options] locations get-lodging <name> [-p <v>]... [-o <out>] lodging-get-google-updated <name> [-p <v>]... [-o <out>] update-lodging <name> (-r <kv>)... [-p <v>]... [-o <out>] mybusinesslodging1 --help Configuration: --config-dir <folder> A directory into which we will store our persistent data. Defaults to a user-writable directory that we will create during the first invocation. [default: ~/.google-service-cli] Configuration The program will store all persistent data in the ~/.google-service-cli directory in JSON files prefixed with mybusinesslodging1- . You can change the directory used to store configuration with the --config-dir flag on a per-invocation basis. More information about the various kinds of persistent data are given in the following paragraphs. Authentication Most APIs require a user to authenticate any request. If this is the case, the scope determines the set of permissions granted. The granularity of these is usually no more than read-only or full-access . If not set, the system will automatically select the smallest feasible scope, e.g. when invoking a method that is read-only, it will ask only for a read-only scope. You may use the --scope flag to specify a scope directly. All applicable scopes are documented in the respective method's CLI documentation. The first time a scope is used, the user is asked for permission. Follow the instructions given by the CLI to grant permissions, or to decline. If a scope was authenticated by the user, the respective information will be stored as JSON in the configuration directory, e.g. ~/.google-service-cli/mybusinesslodging1-token-<scope-hash>.json . No manual management of these tokens is necessary. To revoke granted authentication, please refer to the official documentation . Application Secrets In order to allow any application to use Google services, it will need to be registered using the Google Developer Console . APIs the application may use are then enabled for it one by one. Most APIs can be used for free and have a daily quota. To allow more comfortable usage of the CLI without forcing anyone to register an own application, the CLI comes with a default application secret that is configured accordingly. This also means that heavy usage all around the world may deplete the daily quota. You can workaround this limitation by putting your own secrets file at this location: ~/.google-service-cli/mybusinesslodging1-secret.json , assuming that the required mybusinesslodging API was enabled for it. Such a secret file can be downloaded in the Google Developer Console at APIs & auth -> Credentials -> Download JSON and used as is. Learn more about how to setup Google projects and enable APIs using the official documentation . Debugging Even though the CLI does its best to provide usable error messages, sometimes it might be desirable to know what exactly led to a particular issue. This is done by allowing all client-server communication to be output to standard error as-is . The --debug flag will print errors using the Debug representation to standard error. You may consider redirecting standard error into a file for ease of use, e.g. mybusinesslodging1 --debug <resource> <method> [options] 2>debug.txt .","title":"Home"},{"location":"#installation-and-source-code","text":"Install the command-line interface with cargo using: cargo install google-mybusinesslodging1-cli Find the source code on github .","title":"Installation and Source Code"},{"location":"#usage","text":"This documentation was generated from the My Business Lodging API at revision 20240304 .

About Cursors The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. . Each additional . moves it up one additional level. E.g. ... would go three levels up. Optional Output Flags The method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default. -o out out specifies the destination to which to write the server's result to. It will be a JSON-encoded structure. The destination may be - to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes. If unset, it defaults to standard output. Optional Method Properties You may set the following properties to further configure the call. Please note that -p is followed by one or more key-value-pairs, and is called like this -p k1=v1 k2=v2 even though the listing below repeats the -p for completeness. -p update-mask=string Required. The specific fields to update. Use \"*\" to update all fields, which may include unsetting empty fields in the request. Repeated field items cannot be individually updated. Optional General Properties The following properties can configure any call, and are not specific to this method. -p $-xgafv=string V1 error format. -p access-token=string OAuth access token. -p alt=string Data format for response. -p callback=string JSONP -p fields=string Selector specifying which fields to include in a partial response. -p key=string API key.
