By default all output is printed to standard out, but flags can be set to direct it into a file independent of your shell's capabilities. Errors will be printed to standard error, and cause the program's exit code to be non-zero. If data-structures are requested, these will be returned as pretty-printed JSON, to be useful as input to other tools. Everything else about the Texttospeech API can be found at the official documentation site . Installation and Source Code Install the command-line interface with cargo using: cargo install google-texttospeech1-cli Find the source code on github .

Each scope requires the user to grant this application permission to use it. If unset, it defaults to the shortest scope url for a particular method. --config-dir <folder> A directory into which we will store our persistent data. Defaults to a user-writable directory that we will create during the first invocation. [default: ~/.google-service-cli] Configuration The program will store all persistent data in the ~/.google-service-cli directory in JSON files prefixed with texttospeech1- . You can change the directory used to store configuration with the --config-dir flag on a per-invocation basis. More information about the various kinds of persistent data are given in the following paragraphs. Authentication Most APIs require a user to authenticate any request. If this is the case, the scope determines the set of permissions granted. The granularity of these is usually no more than read-only or full-access . If not set, the system will automatically select the smallest feasible scope, e.g. when invoking a method that is read-only, it will ask only for a read-only scope. You may use the --scope flag to specify a scope directly. All applicable scopes are documented in the respective method's CLI documentation. The first time a scope is used, the user is asked for permission. Follow the instructions given by the CLI to grant permissions, or to decline. If a scope was authenticated by the user, the respective information will be stored as JSON in the configuration directory, e.g. ~/.google-service-cli/texttospeech1-token-<scope-hash>.json . No manual management of these tokens is necessary. To revoke granted authentication, please refer to the official documentation . Application Secrets In order to allow any application to use Google services, it will need to be registered using the Google Developer Console . APIs the application may use are then enabled for it one by one. Most APIs can be used for free and have a daily quota. To allow more comfortable usage of the CLI without forcing anyone to register an own application, the CLI comes with a default application secret that is configured accordingly. This also means that heavy usage all around the world may deplete the daily quota. You can workaround this limitation by putting your own secrets file at this location: ~/.google-service-cli/texttospeech1-secret.json , assuming that the required texttospeech API was enabled for it. Such a secret file can be downloaded in the Google Developer Console at APIs & auth -> Credentials -> Download JSON and used as is. Learn more about how to setup Google projects and enable APIs using the official documentation . Debugging Even though the CLI does its best to provide usable error messages, sometimes it might be desirable to know what exactly led to a particular issue. This is done by allowing all client-server communication to be output to standard error as-is . The --debug flag will print errors using the Debug representation to standard error. You may consider redirecting standard error into a file for ease of use, e.g. texttospeech1 --debug <resource> <method> [options] 2>debug.txt .","title":"Home"},{"location":"#installation-and-source-code","text":"Install the command-line interface with cargo using: cargo install google-texttospeech1-cli Find the source code on github .","title":"Installation and Source Code"},{"location":"#usage","text":"This documentation was generated from the Texttospeech API at revision 20240228 .

Each field may be a simple scalar or another data-structure. In the latter case it is advised to set the field-cursor to the data-structure's field to specify values more concisely. For example, a structure like this: SynthesizeLongAudioRequest: audio-config: audio-encoding: string effects-profile-id: [string] pitch: number sample-rate-hertz: integer speaking-rate: number volume-gain-db: number input: ssml: string text: string output-gcs-uri: string voice: custom-voice: model: string reported-usage: string language-code: string name: string ssml-gender: string can be set completely with the following arguments which are assumed to be executed in the given order. Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time. -r .audio-config audio-encoding=et Required. The format of the audio byte stream. effects-profile-id=magna Optional. Input only. An identifier which selects 'audio effects' profiles that are applied on (post synthesized) text to speech. Effects are applied on top of each other in the order they are given. See audio profiles for current supported profile ids. Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. pitch=0.7098799822170164 Optional. Input only. Speaking pitch, in the range [-20.0, 20.0]. 20 means increase 20 semitones from the original pitch. -20 means decrease 20 semitones from the original pitch. sample-rate-hertz=73 Optional. The synthesis sample rate (in hertz) for this audio. When this is specified in SynthesizeSpeechRequest, if this is different from the voice's natural sample rate, then the synthesizer will honor this request by converting to the desired sample rate (which might result in worse audio quality), unless the specified sample rate is not supported for the encoding chosen, in which case it will fail the request and return google.rpc.Code.INVALID_ARGUMENT. speaking-rate=0.5857873539022715 Optional. Input only. Speaking rate/speed, in the range [0.25, 4.0]. 1.0 is the normal native speed supported by the specific voice. 2.0 is twice as fast, and 0.5 is half as fast. If unset(0.0), defaults to the native 1.0 speed. Any other values < 0.25 or > 4.0 will return an error. volume-gain-db=0.16568728368878083 Optional. Input only. Volume gain (in dB) of the normal native volume supported by the specific voice, in the range [-96.0, 16.0]. If unset, or set to a value of 0.0 (dB), will play at normal native signal amplitude. A value of -6.0 (dB) will play at approximately half the amplitude of the normal native signal amplitude. A value of +6.0 (dB) will play at approximately twice the amplitude of the normal native signal amplitude. Strongly recommend not to exceed +10 (dB) as there's usually no effective increase in loudness for any value greater than that. ..input ssml=takimata The SSML document to be synthesized. The SSML document must be valid and well-formed. Otherwise the RPC will fail and return google.rpc.Code.INVALID_ARGUMENT. For more information, see SSML . text=amet. The raw text to be synthesized. .. output-gcs-uri=duo Required. Specifies a Cloud Storage URI for the synthesis results. Must be specified in the format: gs://bucket_name/object_name , and the bucket must already exist. voice.custom-voice model=ipsum Required. The name of the AutoML model that synthesizes the custom voice. reported-usage=gubergren Optional. Deprecated. The usage of the synthesized audio to be reported. .. language-code=lorem Required. The language (and potentially also the region) of the voice expressed as a BCP-47 language tag, e.g. \"en-US\".

The TTS service will use this parameter to help choose an appropriate voice.

About Cursors The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. . Each additional . moves it up one additional level. E.g. ... would go three levels up. Optional Output Flags The method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default. -o out out specifies the destination to which to write the server's result to.
