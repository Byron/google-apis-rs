By default all output is printed to standard out, but flags can be set to direct it into a file independent of your shell's capabilities. Errors will be printed to standard error, and cause the program's exit code to be non-zero. If data-structures are requested, these will be returned as pretty-printed JSON, to be useful as input to other tools. Everything else about the Security Command Center API can be found at the official documentation site . Installation and Source Code Install the command-line interface with cargo using: cargo install google-securitycenter1-cli Find the source code on github .

Specify the authentication a method should be executed in. Each scope requires the user to grant this application permission to use it. If unset, it defaults to the shortest scope url for a particular method. --config-dir <folder> A directory into which we will store our persistent data. Defaults to a user-writable directory that we will create during the first invocation. [default: ~/.google-service-cli] Configuration The program will store all persistent data in the ~/.google-service-cli directory in JSON files prefixed with securitycenter1- . You can change the directory used to store configuration with the --config-dir flag on a per-invocation basis. More information about the various kinds of persistent data are given in the following paragraphs. Authentication Most APIs require a user to authenticate any request. If this is the case, the scope determines the set of permissions granted. The granularity of these is usually no more than read-only or full-access . If not set, the system will automatically select the smallest feasible scope, e.g. when invoking a method that is read-only, it will ask only for a read-only scope. You may use the --scope flag to specify a scope directly. All applicable scopes are documented in the respective method's CLI documentation. The first time a scope is used, the user is asked for permission. Follow the instructions given by the CLI to grant permissions, or to decline. If a scope was authenticated by the user, the respective information will be stored as JSON in the configuration directory, e.g. ~/.google-service-cli/securitycenter1-token-<scope-hash>.json . No manual management of these tokens is necessary. To revoke granted authentication, please refer to the official documentation . Application Secrets In order to allow any application to use Google services, it will need to be registered using the Google Developer Console . APIs the application may use are then enabled for it one by one. Most APIs can be used for free and have a daily quota. To allow more comfortable usage of the CLI without forcing anyone to register an own application, the CLI comes with a default application secret that is configured accordingly. This also means that heavy usage all around the world may deplete the daily quota. You can workaround this limitation by putting your own secrets file at this location: ~/.google-service-cli/securitycenter1-secret.json , assuming that the required securitycenter API was enabled for it. Such a secret file can be downloaded in the Google Developer Console at APIs & auth -> Credentials -> Download JSON and used as is. Learn more about how to setup Google projects and enable APIs using the official documentation . Debugging Even though the CLI does its best to provide usable error messages, sometimes it might be desirable to know what exactly led to a particular issue. This is done by allowing all client-server communication to be output to standard error as-is . The --debug flag will print errors using the Debug representation to standard error. You may consider redirecting standard error into a file for ease of use, e.g. securitycenter1 --debug <resource> <method> [options] 2>debug.txt .","title":"Home"},{"location":"#installation-and-source-code","text":"Install the command-line interface with cargo using: cargo install google-securitycenter1-cli Find the source code on github .","title":"Installation and Source Code"},{"location":"#usage","text":"This documentation was generated from the Security Command Center API at revision 20240302 .

Each field may be a simple scalar or another data-structure. In the latter case it is advised to set the field-cursor to the data-structure's field to specify values more concisely. For example, a structure like this: GoogleCloudSecuritycenterV1SecurityHealthAnalyticsCustomModule: ancestor-module: string custom-config: description: string predicate: description: string expression: string location: string title: string recommendation: string resource-selector: resource-types: [string] severity: string display-name: string enablement-state: string last-editor: string name: string update-time: string can be set completely with the following arguments which are assumed to be executed in the given order. Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time. -r . ancestor-module=takimata Output only. If empty, indicates that the custom module was created in the organization, folder, or project in which you are viewing the custom module. Otherwise, ancestor_module specifies the organization or folder from which the custom module is inherited. custom-config description=consetetur Text that describes the vulnerability or misconfiguration that the custom module detects. This explanation is returned with each finding instance to help investigators understand the detected issue. The text must be enclosed in quotation marks. predicate description=voluptua. Optional. Description of the expression. This is a longer text which describes the expression, e.g. when hovered over it in a UI. expression=et Textual representation of an expression in Common Expression Language syntax. location=erat Optional. String indicating the location of the expression for error reporting, e.g. a file name and a position in the file. title=consetetur Optional. Title for the expression, i.e. a short string describing its purpose. This can be used e.g. in UIs which allow to enter the expression. .. recommendation=amet. An explanation of the recommended steps that security teams can take to resolve the detected issue. This explanation is returned with each finding generated by this module in the nextSteps property of the finding JSON. resource-selector resource-types=sed The resource types to run the detector on. Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. .. severity=takimata The severity to assign to findings generated by the module. .. display-name=dolores The display name of the Security Health Analytics custom module. This display name becomes the finding category for all findings that are returned by this custom module. The display name must be between 1 and 128 characters, start with a lowercase letter, and contain alphanumeric characters or underscores only. enablement-state=gubergren The enablement state of the custom module. last-editor=et Output only. The editor that last updated the custom module. name=accusam Immutable. The resource name of the custom module. Its format is \"organizations/{organization}/securityHealthAnalyticsSettings/customModules/{customModule}\", or \"folders/{folder}/securityHealthAnalyticsSettings/customModules/{customModule}\", or \"projects/{project}/securityHealthAnalyticsSettings/customModules/{customModule}\" The id {customModule} is server-generated and is not user settable. It will be a numeric id containing 1-20 digits. update-time=voluptua. Output only. The time at which the custom module was last updated. About Cursors The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. . Each additional . moves it up one additional level. E.g. ... would go three levels up. Optional Output Flags The method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default. -o out out specifies the destination to which to write the server's result to. It will be a JSON-encoded structure. The destination may be - to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes. If unset, it defaults to standard output. Optional General Properties The following properties can configure any call, and are not specific to this method. -p $-xgafv=string V1 error format. -p access-token=string OAuth access token. -p alt=string Data format for response. -p callback=string JSONP -p fields=string Selector specifying which fields to include in a partial response. -p key=string API key.

If unset, the scope for this method defaults to https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform . You can set the scope for this method like this: securitycenter1 --scope <scope> folders security-health-analytics-settings-custom-modules-patch ... Required Scalar Argument <name> (string) Immutable. The resource name of the custom module. Its format is \"organizations/{organization}/securityHealthAnalyticsSettings/customModules/{customModule}\", or \"folders/{folder}/securityHealthAnalyticsSettings/customModules/{customModule}\", or \"projects/{project}/securityHealthAnalyticsSettings/customModules/{customModule}\" The id {customModule} is server-generated and is not user settable. It will be a numeric id containing 1-20 digits. Required Request Value The request value is a data-structure with various fields. Each field may be a simple scalar or another data-structure. In the latter case it is advised to set the field-cursor to the data-structure's field to specify values more concisely. For example, a structure like this: GoogleCloudSecuritycenterV1SecurityHealthAnalyticsCustomModule: ancestor-module: string custom-config: description: string predicate: description: string expression: string location: string title: string recommendation: string resource-selector: resource-types: [string] severity: string display-name: string enablement-state: string last-editor: string name: string update-time: string can be set completely with the following arguments which are assumed to be executed in the given order. Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time. -r . ancestor-module=dolore Output only. If empty, indicates that the custom module was created in the organization, folder, or project in which you are viewing the custom module. Otherwise, ancestor_module specifies the organization or folder from which the custom module is inherited. custom-config description=dolore Text that describes the vulnerability or misconfiguration that the custom module detects. This explanation is returned with each finding instance to help investigators understand the detected issue. The text must be enclosed in quotation marks. predicate description=dolore Optional. Description of the expression. This is a longer text which describes the expression, e.g. when hovered over it in a UI. expression=voluptua. Textual representation of an expression in Common Expression Language syntax. location=amet. Optional. String indicating the location of the expression for error reporting, e.g. a file name and a position in the file. title=ea Optional. Title for the expression, i.e. a short string describing its purpose. This can be used e.g. in UIs which allow to enter the expression. .. recommendation=sadipscing An explanation of the recommended steps that security teams can take to resolve the detected issue. This explanation is returned with each finding generated by this module in the nextSteps property of the finding JSON. resource-selector resource-types=lorem The resource types to run the detector on. Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. .. severity=invidunt The severity to assign to findings generated by the module. .. display-name=no The display name of the Security Health Analytics custom module. This display name becomes the finding category for all findings that are returned by this custom module. The display name must be between 1 and 128 characters, start with a lowercase letter, and contain alphanumeric characters or underscores only. enablement-state=est The enablement state of the custom module. last-editor=at Output only.

It will be a numeric id containing 1-20 digits. update-time=sit Output only. The time at which the custom module was last updated. About Cursors The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. . Each additional . moves it up one additional level. E.g. ... would go three levels up. Optional Output Flags The method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default. -o out out specifies the destination to which to write the server's result to. It will be a JSON-encoded structure. The destination may be - to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes. If unset, it defaults to standard output. Optional Method Properties You may set the following properties to further configure the call. Please note that -p is followed by one or more key-value-pairs, and is called like this -p k1=v1 k2=v2 even though the listing below repeats the -p for completeness. -p update-mask=string The list of fields to be updated.

If compare_duration is not specified, then the only possible state_change is \"UNUSED\", which will be the state_change set for all assets present at read_time. If this field is set then state_change must be a specified field in group_by . filter=at Expression that defines the filter to apply across assets.

If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to overwrite a version 3 policy with a version 1 policy, and all of the conditions in the version 3 policy are lost. version=23 Specifies the format of the policy. Valid values are 0 , 1 , and 3 . Requests that specify an invalid value are rejected. Any operation that affects conditional role bindings must specify version 3 . This requirement applies to the following operations: * Getting a policy that includes a conditional role binding * Adding a conditional role binding to a policy * Changing a conditional role binding in a policy * Removing any role binding, with or without a condition, from a policy that includes conditions Important: If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the etag field whenever you call setIamPolicy . If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to overwrite a version 3 policy with a version 1 policy, and all of the conditions in the version 3 policy are lost.

It is strongly suggested that systems make use of the etag in the read-modify-write cycle to perform policy updates in order to avoid race conditions: An etag is returned in the response to getIamPolicy , and systems are expected to put that etag in the request to setIamPolicy to ensure that their change will be applied to the same version of the policy. Important: If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the etag field whenever you call setIamPolicy . If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to overwrite a version 3 policy with a version 1 policy, and all of the conditions in the version 3 policy are lost. version=23 Specifies the format of the policy. Valid values are 0 , 1 , and 3 . Requests that specify an invalid value are rejected. Any operation that affects conditional role bindings must specify version 3 . This requirement applies to the following operations: * Getting a policy that includes a conditional role binding * Adding a conditional role binding to a policy * Changing a conditional role binding in a policy * Removing any role binding, with or without a condition, from a policy that includes conditions Important: If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the etag field whenever you call setIamPolicy . If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to overwrite a version 3 policy with a version 1 policy, and all of the conditions in the version 3 policy are lost. If a policy does not include any conditions, operations on that policy may specify any valid version or leave the field unset.

See: https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/resource_names#relative_resource_name Example: \"organizations/{organization_id}/sources/{source_id}\" About Cursors The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. .

About Cursors The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. . Each additional . moves it up one additional level. E.g. ... would go three levels up.

This is the time between (read_time - compare_duration) and read_time. The state change value is derived based on the presence of the asset at the two points in time. Intermediate state changes between the two times don't affect the result. For example, the results aren't affected if the asset is removed and re-created again. Possible \"state_change\" values when compare_duration is specified: * \"ADDED\": indicates that the asset was not present at the start of compare_duration, but present at reference_time. * \"REMOVED\": indicates that the asset was present at the start of compare_duration, but not present at reference_time. * \"ACTIVE\": indicates that the asset was present at both the start and the end of the time period defined by compare_duration and reference_time. If compare_duration is not specified, then the only possible state_change is \"UNUSED\", which will be the state_change set for all assets present at read_time. If this field is set then state_change must be a specified field in group_by . filter=et Expression that defines the filter to apply across assets. The expression is a list of zero or more restrictions combined via logical operators AND and OR . Parentheses are supported, and OR has higher precedence than AND . Restrictions have the form and may have a - character in front of them to indicate negation. The fields map to those defined in the Asset resource.

Each field may be a simple scalar or another data-structure. In the latter case it is advised to set the field-cursor to the data-structure's field to specify values more concisely. For example, a structure like this: SimulateSecurityHealthAnalyticsCustomModuleRequest: custom-config: description: string predicate: description: string expression: string location: string title: string recommendation: string resource-selector: resource-types: [string] severity: string resource: iam-policy-data: etag: string version: integer resource-type: string can be set completely with the following arguments which are assumed to be executed in the given order. Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time. -r .custom-config description=justo Text that describes the vulnerability or misconfiguration that the custom module detects. This explanation is returned with each finding instance to help investigators understand the detected issue. The text must be enclosed in quotation marks. predicate description=sadipscing Optional. Description of the expression. This is a longer text which describes the expression, e.g. when hovered over it in a UI. expression=accusam Textual representation of an expression in Common Expression Language syntax. location=takimata Optional. String indicating the location of the expression for error reporting, e.g. a file name and a position in the file. title=invidunt Optional. Title for the expression, i.e. a short string describing its purpose. This can be used e.g. in UIs which allow to enter the expression. .. recommendation=invidunt An explanation of the recommended steps that security teams can take to resolve the detected issue. This explanation is returned with each finding generated by this module in the nextSteps property of the finding JSON. resource-selector resource-types=gubergren The resource types to run the detector on. Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. .. severity=sed The severity to assign to findings generated by the module. ..resource.iam-policy-data etag=justo etag is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help prevent simultaneous updates of a policy from overwriting each other. It is strongly suggested that systems make use of the etag in the read-modify-write cycle to perform policy updates in order to avoid race conditions: An etag is returned in the response to getIamPolicy , and systems are expected to put that etag in the request to setIamPolicy to ensure that their change will be applied to the same version of the policy. Important: If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the etag field whenever you call setIamPolicy . If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to overwrite a version 3 policy with a version 1 policy, and all of the conditions in the version 3 policy are lost. version=4 Specifies the format of the policy. Valid values are 0 , 1 , and 3 . Requests that specify an invalid value are rejected. Any operation that affects conditional role bindings must specify version 3 . This requirement applies to the following operations: * Getting a policy that includes a conditional role binding * Adding a conditional role binding to a policy * Changing a conditional role binding in a policy * Removing any role binding, with or without a condition, from a policy that includes conditions Important: If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the etag field whenever you call setIamPolicy . If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to overwrite a version 3 policy with a version 1 policy, and all of the conditions in the version 3 policy are lost. If a policy does not include any conditions, operations on that policy may specify any valid version or leave the field unset. To learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the IAM documentation . .. resource-type=sed Required. The type of the resource, for example, compute.googleapis.com/Disk . About Cursors The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. . Each additional . moves it up one additional level. E.g. ... would go three levels up. Optional Output Flags The method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default. -o out out specifies the destination to which to write the server's result to.

See: https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/resource_names#relative_resource_name Examples: \"organizations/{organization_id}/assets/{asset_id}/securityMarks\" \"organizations/{organization_id}/sources/{source_id}/findings/{finding_id}/securityMarks\". Required Request Value The request value is a data-structure with various fields. Each field may be a simple scalar or another data-structure. In the latter case it is advised to set the field-cursor to the data-structure's field to specify values more concisely. For example, a structure like this: SecurityMarks: canonical-name: string marks: { string: string } name: string can be set completely with the following arguments which are assumed to be executed in the given order. Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time. -r . canonical-name=ipsum The canonical name of the marks. Examples: \"organizations/{organization_id}/assets/{asset_id}/securityMarks\" \"folders/{folder_id}/assets/{asset_id}/securityMarks\" \"projects/{project_number}/assets/{asset_id}/securityMarks\" \"organizations/{organization_id}/sources/{source_id}/findings/{finding_id}/securityMarks\" \"folders/{folder_id}/sources/{source_id}/findings/{finding_id}/securityMarks\" \"projects/{project_number}/sources/{source_id}/findings/{finding_id}/securityMarks\" marks=key=dolor Mutable user specified security marks belonging to the parent resource. Constraints are as follows: * Keys and values are treated as case insensitive * Keys must be between 1 - 256 characters (inclusive) * Keys must be letters, numbers, underscores, or dashes * Values have leading and trailing whitespace trimmed, remaining characters must be between 1 - 4096 characters (inclusive) the value will be associated with the given key name=elitr The relative resource name of the SecurityMarks. See: https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/resource_names#relative_resource_name Examples: \"organizations/{organization_id}/assets/{asset_id}/securityMarks\" \"organizations/{organization_id}/sources/{source_id}/findings/{finding_id}/securityMarks\". About Cursors The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. . Each additional . moves it up one additional level. E.g. ... would go three levels up. Optional Output Flags The method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default. -o out out specifies the destination to which to write the server's result to. It will be a JSON-encoded structure. The destination may be - to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes. If unset, it defaults to standard output. Optional Method Properties You may set the following properties to further configure the call. Please note that -p is followed by one or more key-value-pairs, and is called like this -p k1=v1 k2=v2 even though the listing below repeats the -p for completeness. -p start-time=string The time at which the updated SecurityMarks take effect. If not set uses current server time. Updates will be applied to the SecurityMarks that are active immediately preceding this time. Must be earlier or equal to the server time. -p update-mask=string The FieldMask to use when updating the security marks resource. The field mask must not contain duplicate fields. If empty or set to \"marks\", all marks will be replaced. Individual marks can be updated using \"marks.\". Optional General Properties The following properties can configure any call, and are not specific to this method. -p $-xgafv=string V1 error format. -p access-token=string OAuth access token. -p alt=string Data format for response. -p callback=string JSONP -p fields=string Selector specifying which fields to include in a partial response. -p key=string API key. Your API key identifies your project and provides you with API access, quota, and reports. Required unless you provide an OAuth 2.0 token. -p oauth-token=string OAuth 2.0 token for the current user. -p pretty-print=boolean Returns response with indentations and line breaks. -p quota-user=string Available to use for quota purposes for server-side applications. Can be any arbitrary string assigned to a user, but should not exceed 40 characters. -p upload-type=string Legacy upload protocol for media (e.g. \"media\", \"multipart\"). -p upload-protocol=string Upload protocol for media (e.g. \"raw\", \"multipart\").","title":"Sources Findings Update Security Marks"},{"location":"projects_sources-findings-update-security-marks/#scopes","text":"You will need authorization for the https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform scope to make a valid call.
