By default all output is printed to standard out, but flags can be set to direct it into a file independent of your shell's capabilities. Errors will be printed to standard error, and cause the program's exit code to be non-zero. If data-structures are requested, these will be returned as pretty-printed JSON, to be useful as input to other tools. Everything else about the Cloud Healthcare API can be found at the official documentation site . Installation and Source Code Install the command-line interface with cargo using: cargo install google-healthcare1_beta1-cli Find the source code on github .

[-o <out>] healthcare1-beta1 --help Configuration: [--scope <url>]... Specify the authentication a method should be executed in. Each scope requires the user to grant this application permission to use it. If unset, it defaults to the shortest scope url for a particular method. --config-dir <folder> A directory into which we will store our persistent data. Defaults to a user-writable directory that we will create during the first invocation. [default: ~/.google-service-cli] Configuration The program will store all persistent data in the ~/.google-service-cli directory in JSON files prefixed with healthcare1-beta1- . You can change the directory used to store configuration with the --config-dir flag on a per-invocation basis. More information about the various kinds of persistent data are given in the following paragraphs. Authentication Most APIs require a user to authenticate any request. If this is the case, the scope determines the set of permissions granted. The granularity of these is usually no more than read-only or full-access . If not set, the system will automatically select the smallest feasible scope, e.g. when invoking a method that is read-only, it will ask only for a read-only scope. You may use the --scope flag to specify a scope directly. All applicable scopes are documented in the respective method's CLI documentation. The first time a scope is used, the user is asked for permission. Follow the instructions given by the CLI to grant permissions, or to decline. If a scope was authenticated by the user, the respective information will be stored as JSON in the configuration directory, e.g. ~/.google-service-cli/healthcare1-beta1-token-<scope-hash>.json . No manual management of these tokens is necessary. To revoke granted authentication, please refer to the official documentation . Application Secrets In order to allow any application to use Google services, it will need to be registered using the Google Developer Console . APIs the application may use are then enabled for it one by one. Most APIs can be used for free and have a daily quota. To allow more comfortable usage of the CLI without forcing anyone to register an own application, the CLI comes with a default application secret that is configured accordingly. This also means that heavy usage all around the world may deplete the daily quota. You can workaround this limitation by putting your own secrets file at this location: ~/.google-service-cli/healthcare1-beta1-secret.json , assuming that the required healthcare API was enabled for it. Such a secret file can be downloaded in the Google Developer Console at APIs & auth -> Credentials -> Download JSON and used as is. Learn more about how to setup Google projects and enable APIs using the official documentation . Debugging Even though the CLI does its best to provide usable error messages, sometimes it might be desirable to know what exactly led to a particular issue. This is done by allowing all client-server communication to be output to standard error as-is . The --debug flag will print errors using the Debug representation to standard error. You may consider redirecting standard error into a file for ease of use, e.g. healthcare1-beta1 --debug <resource> <method> [options] 2>debug.txt .","title":"Home"},{"location":"#installation-and-source-code","text":"Install the command-line interface with cargo using: cargo install google-healthcare1_beta1-cli Find the source code on github .","title":"Installation and Source Code"},{"location":"#usage","text":"This documentation was generated from the Cloud Healthcare API at revision 20240228 .

If this is the case, the scope determines the set of permissions granted. The granularity of these is usually no more than read-only or full-access .

You may use the --scope flag to specify a scope directly. All applicable scopes are documented in the respective method's CLI documentation. The first time a scope is used, the user is asked for permission. Follow the instructions given by the CLI to grant permissions, or to decline. If a scope was authenticated by the user, the respective information will be stored as JSON in the configuration directory, e.g. ~/.google-service-cli/healthcare1-beta1-token-<scope-hash>.json .

For example, &#34;Comment = great&#34; returns messages with great in the comment field. * A number field value can be written as an integer, a decimal, or an exponential. The valid relational operators for number fields are the equality operator ( = ), along with the less than/greater than operators ( &lt; , &lt;= , &gt; , &gt;= ). Note that there is no inequality ( != ) operator. You can prepend the NOT operator to an expression to negate it. * A date field value must be written in yyyy-mm-dd form.

Note that there is no inequality ( != ) operator. You can prepend the NOT operator to an expression to negate it. * Multiple field query expressions can be combined in one query by adding AND or OR operators between the expressions. If a boolean operator appears within a quoted string, it is not treated as special, it's just another part of the character string to be matched.

Restricts the user data mappings returned to those matching a filter. The following syntax is available: * A string field value can be written as text inside quotation marks, for example &#34;query text&#34; . The only valid relational operation for text fields is equality ( = ), where text is searched within the field, rather than having the field be equal to the text. For example, &#34;Comment = great&#34; returns messages with great in the comment field. * A number field value can be written as an integer, a decimal, or an exponential. The valid relational operators for number fields are the equality operator ( = ), along with the less than/greater than operators ( &lt; , &lt;= , &gt; , &gt;= ). Note that there is no inequality ( != ) operator. You can prepend the NOT operator to an expression to negate it. * A date field value must be written in yyyy-mm-dd form. Fields with date and time use the RFC3339 time format. Leading zeros are required for one-digit months and days. The valid relational operators for date fields are the equality operator ( = ) , along with the less than/greater than operators ( &lt; , &lt;= , &gt; , &gt;= ). Note that there is no inequality ( != ) operator. You can prepend the NOT operator to an expression to negate it. * Multiple field query expressions can be combined in one query by adding AND or OR operators between the expressions. If a boolean operator appears within a quoted string, it is not treated as special, it's just another part of the character string to be matched. You can prepend the NOT operator to an expression to negate it. The fields available for filtering are: - data_id - user_id. For example, filter=user_id=\\&#34;user123\\&#34; . - archived - archive_time -p page-size=integer Optional. Limit on the number of User data mappings to return in a single response. If not specified, 100 is used. May not be larger than 1000. -p page-token=string Optional. Token to retrieve the next page of results, or empty to get the first page.

Restricts the user data mappings returned to those matching a filter. The following syntax is available: * A string field value can be written as text inside quotation marks, for example &#34;query text&#34; . The only valid relational operation for text fields is equality ( = ), where text is searched within the field, rather than having the field be equal to the text. For example, &#34;Comment = great&#34; returns messages with great in the comment field. * A number field value can be written as an integer, a decimal, or an exponential. The valid relational operators for number fields are the equality operator ( = ), along with the less than/greater than operators ( &lt; , &lt;= , &gt; , &gt;= ). Note that there is no inequality ( != ) operator. You can prepend the NOT operator to an expression to negate it. * A date field value must be written in yyyy-mm-dd form. Fields with date and time use the RFC3339 time format. Leading zeros are required for one-digit months and days. The valid relational operators for date fields are the equality operator ( = ) , along with the less than/greater than operators ( &lt; , &lt;= , &gt; , &gt;= ). Note that there is no inequality ( != ) operator. You can prepend the NOT operator to an expression to negate it. * Multiple field query expressions can be combined in one query by adding AND or OR operators between the expressions. If a boolean operator appears within a quoted string, it is not treated as special, it's just another part of the character string to be matched. You can prepend the NOT operator to an expression to negate it. The fields available for filtering are: - data_id - user_id. For example, filter=user_id=\\&#34;user123\\&#34; . - archived - archive_time -p page-size=integer Optional. Limit on the number of User data mappings to return in a single response.

The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. . Each additional . moves it up one additional level. E.g. ... would go three levels up. Optional Output Flags The method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default. -o out out specifies the destination to which to write the server's result to. It will be a JSON-encoded structure. The destination may be - to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes. If unset, it defaults to standard output.

Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time. -r . complex-data-type-reference-parsing=rebum. Enable parsing of references within complex FHIR data types such as Extensions. If this value is set to ENABLED, then features like referential integrity and Bundle reference rewriting apply to all references. If this flag has not been specified the behavior of the FHIR store will not change, references in complex data types will not be parsed. New stores will have this value set to ENABLED after a notification period. Warning: turning on this flag causes processing existing resources to fail if they contain references to non-existent resources. consent-config.access-determination-log-config log-level=at Optional.

If set to true, when accessing FHIR resources, the consent headers will be verified against consents given by patients. See the ConsentEnforcementVersion for the supported consent headers. consent-header-handling profile=clita Optional. Specifies the default server behavior when the header is empty. If not specified, the ScopeProfile.PERMIT_EMPTY_SCOPE option is used. .. enforced-admin-consents=stet The versioned names of the enforced admin Consent resource(s), in the format projects/{project_id}/locations/{location}/datasets/{dataset_id}/fhirStores/{fhir_store_id}/fhir/Consent/{resource_id}/_history/{version_id} . For FHIR stores with disable_resource_versioning=true , the format is projects/{project_id}/locations/{location}/datasets/{dataset_id}/fhirStores/{fhir_store_id}/fhir/Consent/{resource_id} . This field can only be updated using ApplyAdminConsents. Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. version=aliquyam Required. Specifies which consent enforcement version is being used for this FHIR store. This field can only be set once by either CreateFhirStore or UpdateFhirStore. After that, you must call ApplyConsents to change the version. .. default-search-handling-strict=false If true, overrides the default search behavior for this FHIR store to handling=strict which returns an error for unrecognized search parameters. If false, uses the FHIR specification default handling=lenient which ignores unrecognized search parameters. The handling can always be changed from the default on an individual API call by setting the HTTP header Prefer: handling=strict or Prefer: handling=lenient . disable-referential-integrity=true Immutable. Whether to disable referential integrity in this FHIR store. This field is immutable after FHIR store creation. The default value is false, meaning that the API enforces referential integrity and fails the requests that result in inconsistent state in the FHIR store. When this field is set to true, the API skips referential integrity checks. Consequently, operations that rely on references, such as GetPatientEverything, do not return all the results if broken references exist. disable-resource-versioning=true Immutable. Whether to disable resource versioning for this FHIR store. This field can not be changed after the creation of FHIR store. If set to false, which is the default behavior, all write operations cause historical versions to be recorded automatically. The historical versions can be fetched through the history APIs, but cannot be updated. If set to true, no historical versions are kept. The server sends errors for attempts to read the historical versions. enable-history-modifications=false Optional. Whether to allow ExecuteBundle to accept history bundles, and directly insert and overwrite historical resource versions into the FHIR store. If set to false, using history bundles fails with an error. enable-update-create=false Whether this FHIR store has the updateCreate capability . This determines if the client can use an Update operation to create a new resource with a client-specified ID. If false, all IDs are server-assigned through the Create operation and attempts to update a non-existent resource return errors. It is strongly advised not to include or encode any sensitive data such as patient identifiers in client-specified resource IDs. Those IDs are part of the FHIR resource path recorded in Cloud audit logs and Pub/Sub notifications. Those IDs can also be contained in reference fields within other resources. labels=key=magna User-supplied key-value pairs used to organize FHIR stores.

Identifier. Resource name of the FHIR store, of the form projects/{project_id}/datasets/{dataset_id}/fhirStores/{fhir_store_id} . notification-config pubsub-topic=nonumy The Pub/Sub topic that notifications of changes are published on. Supplied by the client. PubsubMessage.Data contains the resource name. PubsubMessage.MessageId is the ID of this message. It is guaranteed to be unique within the topic. PubsubMessage.PublishTime is the time at which the message was published. Notifications are only sent if the topic is non-empty. Topic names must be scoped to a project. Cloud Healthcare API service account must have publisher permissions on the given Pub/Sub topic. Not having adequate permissions causes the calls that send notifications to fail. If a notification can't be published to Pub/Sub, errors are logged to Cloud Logging (see Viewing error logs in Cloud Logging ). If the number of errors exceeds a certain rate, some aren't submitted. Note that not all operations trigger notifications, see Configuring Pub/Sub notifications for specific details. send-for-bulk-import=true Indicates whether or not to send Pub/Sub notifications on bulk import. Only supported for DICOM imports. ..validation-config disable-fhirpath-validation=true Whether to disable FHIRPath validation for incoming resources. Set this to true to disable checking incoming resources for conformance against FHIRPath requirement defined in the FHIR specification. This property only affects resource types that do not have profiles configured for them, any rules in enabled implementation guides will still be enforced. disable-profile-validation=false Whether to disable profile validation for this FHIR store. Set this to true to disable checking incoming resources for conformance against StructureDefinitions in this FHIR store. disable-reference-type-validation=false Whether to disable reference type validation for incoming resources. Set this to true to disable checking incoming resources for conformance against reference type requirement defined in the FHIR specification. This property only affects resource types that do not have profiles configured for them, any rules in enabled implementation guides will still be enforced. disable-required-field-validation=false Whether to disable required fields validation for incoming resources. Set this to true to disable checking incoming resources for conformance against required fields requirement defined in the FHIR specification. This property only affects resource types that do not have profiles configured for them, any rules in enabled implementation guides will still be enforced. enabled-implementation-guides=erat A list of ImplementationGuide URLs in this FHIR store that are used to configure the profiles to use for validation. For example, to use the US Core profiles for validation, set enabled_implementation_guides to [&#34;http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/ImplementationGuide/ig&#34;] . If enabled_implementation_guides is empty or omitted, then incoming resources are only required to conform to the base FHIR profiles. Otherwise, a resource must conform to at least one profile listed in the global property of one of the enabled ImplementationGuides. The Cloud Healthcare API does not currently enforce all of the rules in a StructureDefinition. The following rules are supported: - min/max - minValue/maxValue - maxLength - type - fixed[x] - pattern[x] on simple types - slicing, when using \"value\" as the discriminator type When a URL cannot be resolved (for example, in a type assertion), the server does not return an error. Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. .. version=justo Required. Immutable. The FHIR specification version that this FHIR store supports natively. This field is immutable after store creation. Requests are rejected if they contain FHIR resources of a different version. Version is required for every FHIR store. About Cursors The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. . Each additional . moves it up one additional level. E.g. ... would go three levels up. Optional Output Flags The method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default. -o out out specifies the destination to which to write the server's result to.

Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time. -r . complex-data-type-reference-parsing=rebum. Enable parsing of references within complex FHIR data types such as Extensions. If this value is set to ENABLED, then features like referential integrity and Bundle reference rewriting apply to all references. If this flag has not been specified the behavior of the FHIR store will not change, references in complex data types will not be parsed. New stores will have this value set to ENABLED after a notification period. Warning: turning on this flag causes processing existing resources to fail if they contain references to non-existent resources. consent-config.access-determination-log-config log-level=at Optional. Controls the amount of detail to include as part of the audit logs. .. access-enforced=false Optional. If set to true, when accessing FHIR resources, the consent headers will be verified against consents given by patients. See the ConsentEnforcementVersion for the supported consent headers. consent-header-handling profile=clita Optional. Specifies the default server behavior when the header is empty. If not specified, the ScopeProfile.PERMIT_EMPTY_SCOPE option is used. .. enforced-admin-consents=stet The versioned names of the enforced admin Consent resource(s), in the format projects/{project_id}/locations/{location}/datasets/{dataset_id}/fhirStores/{fhir_store_id}/fhir/Consent/{resource_id}/_history/{version_id} . For FHIR stores with disable_resource_versioning=true , the format is projects/{project_id}/locations/{location}/datasets/{dataset_id}/fhirStores/{fhir_store_id}/fhir/Consent/{resource_id} . This field can only be updated using ApplyAdminConsents. Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. version=aliquyam Required. Specifies which consent enforcement version is being used for this FHIR store. This field can only be set once by either CreateFhirStore or UpdateFhirStore. After that, you must call ApplyConsents to change the version. .. default-search-handling-strict=false If true, overrides the default search behavior for this FHIR store to handling=strict which returns an error for unrecognized search parameters. If false, uses the FHIR specification default handling=lenient which ignores unrecognized search parameters. The handling can always be changed from the default on an individual API call by setting the HTTP header Prefer: handling=strict or Prefer: handling=lenient . disable-referential-integrity=true Immutable. Whether to disable referential integrity in this FHIR store. This field is immutable after FHIR store creation. The default value is false, meaning that the API enforces referential integrity and fails the requests that result in inconsistent state in the FHIR store. When this field is set to true, the API skips referential integrity checks. Consequently, operations that rely on references, such as GetPatientEverything, do not return all the results if broken references exist. disable-resource-versioning=true Immutable. Whether to disable resource versioning for this FHIR store. This field can not be changed after the creation of FHIR store. If set to false, which is the default behavior, all write operations cause historical versions to be recorded automatically. The historical versions can be fetched through the history APIs, but cannot be updated. If set to true, no historical versions are kept. The server sends errors for attempts to read the historical versions. enable-history-modifications=false Optional. Whether to allow ExecuteBundle to accept history bundles, and directly insert and overwrite historical resource versions into the FHIR store. If set to false, using history bundles fails with an error. enable-update-create=false Whether this FHIR store has the updateCreate capability . This determines if the client can use an Update operation to create a new resource with a client-specified ID. If false, all IDs are server-assigned through the Create operation and attempts to update a non-existent resource return errors. It is strongly advised not to include or encode any sensitive data such as patient identifiers in client-specified resource IDs. Those IDs are part of the FHIR resource path recorded in Cloud audit logs and Pub/Sub notifications. Those IDs can also be contained in reference fields within other resources. labels=key=magna User-supplied key-value pairs used to organize FHIR stores. Label keys must be between 1 and 63 characters long, have a UTF-8 encoding of maximum 128 bytes, and must conform to the following PCRE regular expression: \\p{Ll}\\p{Lo}{0,62} Label values are optional, must be between 1 and 63 characters long, have a UTF-8 encoding of maximum 128 bytes, and must conform to the following PCRE regular expression: [\\p{Ll}\\p{Lo}\\p{N}_-]{0,63} No more than 64 labels can be associated with a given store. the value will be associated with the given key name=diam Output only. Identifier. Resource name of the FHIR store, of the form projects/{project_id}/datasets/{dataset_id}/fhirStores/{fhir_store_id} . notification-config pubsub-topic=nonumy The Pub/Sub topic that notifications of changes are published on. Supplied by the client. PubsubMessage.Data contains the resource name. PubsubMessage.MessageId is the ID of this message. It is guaranteed to be unique within the topic. PubsubMessage.PublishTime is the time at which the message was published. Notifications are only sent if the topic is non-empty. Topic names must be scoped to a project. Cloud Healthcare API service account must have publisher permissions on the given Pub/Sub topic. Not having adequate permissions causes the calls that send notifications to fail. If a notification can't be published to Pub/Sub, errors are logged to Cloud Logging (see Viewing error logs in Cloud Logging ). If the number of errors exceeds a certain rate, some aren't submitted. Note that not all operations trigger notifications, see Configuring Pub/Sub notifications for specific details. send-for-bulk-import=true Indicates whether or not to send Pub/Sub notifications on bulk import. Only supported for DICOM imports. ..validation-config disable-fhirpath-validation=true Whether to disable FHIRPath validation for incoming resources. Set this to true to disable checking incoming resources for conformance against FHIRPath requirement defined in the FHIR specification. This property only affects resource types that do not have profiles configured for them, any rules in enabled implementation guides will still be enforced. disable-profile-validation=false Whether to disable profile validation for this FHIR store. Set this to true to disable checking incoming resources for conformance against StructureDefinitions in this FHIR store. disable-reference-type-validation=false Whether to disable reference type validation for incoming resources. Set this to true to disable checking incoming resources for conformance against reference type requirement defined in the FHIR specification. This property only affects resource types that do not have profiles configured for them, any rules in enabled implementation guides will still be enforced. disable-required-field-validation=false Whether to disable required fields validation for incoming resources. Set this to true to disable checking incoming resources for conformance against required fields requirement defined in the FHIR specification. This property only affects resource types that do not have profiles configured for them, any rules in enabled implementation guides will still be enforced. enabled-implementation-guides=erat A list of ImplementationGuide URLs in this FHIR store that are used to configure the profiles to use for validation. For example, to use the US Core profiles for validation, set enabled_implementation_guides to [&#34;http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/ImplementationGuide/ig&#34;] . If enabled_implementation_guides is empty or omitted, then incoming resources are only required to conform to the base FHIR profiles. Otherwise, a resource must conform to at least one profile listed in the global property of one of the enabled ImplementationGuides. The Cloud Healthcare API does not currently enforce all of the rules in a StructureDefinition. The following rules are supported: - min/max - minValue/maxValue - maxLength - type - fixed[x] - pattern[x] on simple types - slicing, when using \"value\" as the discriminator type When a URL cannot be resolved (for example, in a type assertion), the server does not return an error. Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. .. version=justo Required. Immutable. The FHIR specification version that this FHIR store supports natively.

Implements the FHIR standard batch/transaction interaction and history operations. ( DSTU2 , STU3 , R4 ). Supports all interactions within a bundle, except search. This method accepts Bundles of type batch , transaction and history , processing batch and transaction bundles according to the batch processing rules ( DSTU2 , STU3 , R4 ) and transaction processing rules ( DSTU2 , STU3 , R4 ). The request body must contain a JSON-encoded FHIR Bundle resource, and the request headers must contain Content-Type: application/fhir+json . For a batch bundle or a successful transaction, the response body contains a JSON-encoded representation of a Bundle resource of type batch-response or transaction-response containing one entry for each entry in the request, with the outcome of processing the entry. In the case of an error for a transaction or history bundle, the response body contains a JSON-encoded OperationOutcome resource describing the reason for the error. If the request cannot be mapped to a valid API method on a FHIR store, a generic GCP error might be returned instead. This method checks permissions for each request in the bundle. The executeBundle permission is required to call this method, but you must also grant sufficient permissions to execute the individual requests in the bundle. For example, if the bundle contains a request to create a FHIR resource, the caller must also have been granted the healthcare.fhirResources.create permission. history bundles also check the import permission. You can use audit logs to view the permissions for executeBundle and each request in the bundle. For more information, see Viewing Cloud Audit logs .

Implements the FHIR standard search interaction ( DSTU2 , STU3 , R4 ) using the search semantics described in the FHIR Search specification ( DSTU2 , STU3 , R4 ). Supports four methods of search defined by the specification: * GET [base]?[parameters] to search across all resources. * GET [base]/[type]?[parameters] to search resources of a specified type. * POST [base]/_search?[parameters] as an alternate form having the same semantics as the GET method across all resources. * POST [base]/[type]/_search?[parameters] as an alternate form having the same semantics as the GET method for the specified type. The GET and POST methods do not support compartment searches. The POST method does not support application/x-www-form-urlencoded search parameters. On success, the response body contains a JSON-encoded representation of a Bundle resource of type searchset , containing the results of the search. Errors generated by the FHIR store contain a JSON-encoded OperationOutcome resource describing the reason for the error. If the request cannot be mapped to a valid API method on a FHIR store, a generic GCP error might be returned instead. The server's capability statement, retrieved through capabilities, indicates what search parameters are supported on each FHIR resource. A list of all search parameters defined by the specification can be found in the FHIR Search Parameter Registry ( STU3 , R4 ). FHIR search parameters for DSTU2 can be found on each resource's definition page. Supported search modifiers: :missing , :exact , :contains , :text , :in , :not-in , :above , :below , :[type] , :not , and recurse (DSTU2 and STU3) or :iterate (R4). Supported search result parameters: _sort , _count , _include , _revinclude , _summary=text , _summary=data , and _elements . The maximum number of search results returned defaults to 100, which can be overridden by the _count parameter up to a maximum limit of 1000. The server might return fewer resources than requested to prevent excessively large responses. If there are additional results, the returned Bundle contains a link of relation \"next\", which has a _page_token parameter for an opaque pagination token that can be used to retrieve the next page. Resources with a total size larger than 5MB or a field count larger than 50,000 might not be fully searchable as the server might trim its generated search index in those cases. Note: FHIR resources are indexed asynchronously, so there might be a slight delay between the time a resource is created or changed, and the time when the change reflects in search results. The only exception is resource identifier data, which is indexed synchronously as a special index. As a result, searching using resource identifier is not subject to indexing delay. To use the special synchronous index, the search term for identifier should be in the pattern identifier=[system]|[value] or identifier=[value] , and any of the following search result parameters can be used: * _count * _include * _revinclude * _summary * _elements If your query contains any other search parameters, the standard asynchronous index will be used instead. Note that searching against the special index is optimized for resolving a small number of matches. The search isn't optimized if your identifier search criteria matches a large number (i.e. more than 2,000) of resources. For a search query that will match a large number of resources, you can avoiding using the special synchronous index by including an additional _sort parameter in your query. Use _sort=-_lastUpdated if you want to keep the default sorting order. Note: The special synchronous identifier index are currently disabled for DocumentReference and DocumentManifest searches.

This method is optimized to load large quantities of data using import semantics that ignore some FHIR store configuration options and are not suitable for all use cases. It is primarily intended to load data into an empty FHIR store that is not being used by other clients. In cases where this method is not appropriate, consider using ExecuteBundle to load data. Every resource in the input must contain a client-supplied ID. Each resource is stored using the supplied ID regardless of the enable_update_create setting on the FHIR store. It is strongly advised not to include or encode any sensitive data such as patient identifiers in client-specified resource IDs. Those IDs are part of the FHIR resource path recorded in Cloud Audit Logs and Cloud Pub/Sub notifications. Those IDs can also be contained in reference fields within other resources. The import process does not enforce referential integrity, regardless of the disable_referential_integrity setting on the FHIR store. This allows the import of resources with arbitrary interdependencies without considering grouping or ordering, but if the input data contains invalid references or if some resources fail to be imported, the FHIR store might be left in a state that violates referential integrity. The import process does not trigger Pub/Sub notification or BigQuery streaming update, regardless of how those are configured on the FHIR store. If a resource with the specified ID already exists, the most recent version of the resource is overwritten without creating a new historical version, regardless of the disable_resource_versioning setting on the FHIR store. If transient failures occur during the import, it is possible that successfully imported resources will be overwritten more than once. The import operation is idempotent unless the input data contains multiple valid resources with the same ID but different contents. In that case, after the import completes, the store contains exactly one resource with that ID but there is no ordering guarantee on which version of the contents it will have. The operation result counters do not count duplicate IDs as an error and count one success for each resource in the input, which might result in a success count larger than the number of resources in the FHIR store. This often occurs when importing data organized in bundles produced by Patient-everything where each bundle contains its own copy of a resource such as Practitioner that might be referred to by many patients. If some resources fail to import, for example due to parsing errors, successfully imported resources are not rolled back. The location and format of the input data are specified by the parameters in ImportResourcesRequest. Note that if no format is specified, this method assumes the BUNDLE format. When using the BUNDLE format this method ignores the Bundle.type field, except that history bundles are rejected, and does not apply any of the bundle processing semantics for batch or transaction bundles. Unlike in ExecuteBundle, transaction bundles are not executed as a single transaction and bundle-internal references are not rewritten. The bundle is treated as a collection of resources to be written as provided in Bundle.entry.resource , ignoring Bundle.entry.request . As an example, this allows the import of searchset bundles produced by a FHIR search or Patient-everything operation. This method returns an Operation that can be used to track the status of the import by calling GetOperation. Immediate fatal errors appear in the error field, errors are also logged to Cloud Logging (see Viewing error logs in Cloud Logging ). Otherwise, when the operation finishes, a detailed response of type ImportResourcesResponse is returned in the response field. The metadata field type for this operation is OperationMetadata.

Required Request Value The request value is a data-structure with various fields. Each field may be a simple scalar or another data-structure. In the latter case it is advised to set the field-cursor to the data-structure's field to specify values more concisely. For example, a structure like this: ImportResourcesRequest: content-structure: string gcs-source: uri: string can be set completely with the following arguments which are assumed to be executed in the given order. Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time. -r . content-structure=at The content structure in the source location. If not specified, the server treats the input source files as BUNDLE. gcs-source uri=sit Points to a Cloud Storage URI containing file(s) to import. The URI must be in the following format: gs://{bucket_id}/{object_id} . The URI can include wildcards in object_id and thus identify multiple files. Supported wildcards: * * to match 0 or more non-separator characters * ** to match 0 or more characters (including separators). Must be used at the end of a path and with no other wildcards in the path. Can also be used with a file extension (such as .ndjson), which imports all files with the extension in the specified directory and its sub-directories. For example, gs://my-bucket/my-directory/**.ndjson imports all files with .ndjson extensions in my-directory/ and its sub-directories. * ? to match 1 character Files matching the wildcard are expected to contain content only, no metadata. About Cursors The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. .

Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time. -r . complex-data-type-reference-parsing=sit Enable parsing of references within complex FHIR data types such as Extensions. If this value is set to ENABLED, then features like referential integrity and Bundle reference rewriting apply to all references. If this flag has not been specified the behavior of the FHIR store will not change, references in complex data types will not be parsed. New stores will have this value set to ENABLED after a notification period. Warning: turning on this flag causes processing existing resources to fail if they contain references to non-existent resources. consent-config.access-determination-log-config log-level=lorem Optional.

For FHIR stores with disable_resource_versioning=true , the format is projects/{project_id}/locations/{location}/datasets/{dataset_id}/fhirStores/{fhir_store_id}/fhir/Consent/{resource_id} . This field can only be updated using ApplyAdminConsents. Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. version=erat Required. Specifies which consent enforcement version is being used for this FHIR store. This field can only be set once by either CreateFhirStore or UpdateFhirStore. After that, you must call ApplyConsents to change the version. .. default-search-handling-strict=false If true, overrides the default search behavior for this FHIR store to handling=strict which returns an error for unrecognized search parameters. If false, uses the FHIR specification default handling=lenient which ignores unrecognized search parameters. The handling can always be changed from the default on an individual API call by setting the HTTP header Prefer: handling=strict or Prefer: handling=lenient . disable-referential-integrity=true Immutable. Whether to disable referential integrity in this FHIR store. This field is immutable after FHIR store creation. The default value is false, meaning that the API enforces referential integrity and fails the requests that result in inconsistent state in the FHIR store. When this field is set to true, the API skips referential integrity checks. Consequently, operations that rely on references, such as GetPatientEverything, do not return all the results if broken references exist. disable-resource-versioning=true Immutable. Whether to disable resource versioning for this FHIR store. This field can not be changed after the creation of FHIR store. If set to false, which is the default behavior, all write operations cause historical versions to be recorded automatically. The historical versions can be fetched through the history APIs, but cannot be updated. If set to true, no historical versions are kept. The server sends errors for attempts to read the historical versions. enable-history-modifications=true Optional. Whether to allow ExecuteBundle to accept history bundles, and directly insert and overwrite historical resource versions into the FHIR store. If set to false, using history bundles fails with an error. enable-update-create=false Whether this FHIR store has the updateCreate capability . This determines if the client can use an Update operation to create a new resource with a client-specified ID. If false, all IDs are server-assigned through the Create operation and attempts to update a non-existent resource return errors. It is strongly advised not to include or encode any sensitive data such as patient identifiers in client-specified resource IDs. Those IDs are part of the FHIR resource path recorded in Cloud audit logs and Pub/Sub notifications. Those IDs can also be contained in reference fields within other resources. labels=key=kasd User-supplied key-value pairs used to organize FHIR stores.

Identifier. Resource name of the FHIR store, of the form projects/{project_id}/datasets/{dataset_id}/fhirStores/{fhir_store_id} . notification-config pubsub-topic=sit The Pub/Sub topic that notifications of changes are published on. Supplied by the client. PubsubMessage.Data contains the resource name. PubsubMessage.MessageId is the ID of this message. It is guaranteed to be unique within the topic. PubsubMessage.PublishTime is the time at which the message was published. Notifications are only sent if the topic is non-empty. Topic names must be scoped to a project. Cloud Healthcare API service account must have publisher permissions on the given Pub/Sub topic. Not having adequate permissions causes the calls that send notifications to fail. If a notification can't be published to Pub/Sub, errors are logged to Cloud Logging (see Viewing error logs in Cloud Logging ). If the number of errors exceeds a certain rate, some aren't submitted. Note that not all operations trigger notifications, see Configuring Pub/Sub notifications for specific details. send-for-bulk-import=true Indicates whether or not to send Pub/Sub notifications on bulk import. Only supported for DICOM imports. ..validation-config disable-fhirpath-validation=true Whether to disable FHIRPath validation for incoming resources. Set this to true to disable checking incoming resources for conformance against FHIRPath requirement defined in the FHIR specification. This property only affects resource types that do not have profiles configured for them, any rules in enabled implementation guides will still be enforced. disable-profile-validation=true Whether to disable profile validation for this FHIR store. Set this to true to disable checking incoming resources for conformance against StructureDefinitions in this FHIR store. disable-reference-type-validation=false Whether to disable reference type validation for incoming resources. Set this to true to disable checking incoming resources for conformance against reference type requirement defined in the FHIR specification. This property only affects resource types that do not have profiles configured for them, any rules in enabled implementation guides will still be enforced. disable-required-field-validation=true Whether to disable required fields validation for incoming resources. Set this to true to disable checking incoming resources for conformance against required fields requirement defined in the FHIR specification. This property only affects resource types that do not have profiles configured for them, any rules in enabled implementation guides will still be enforced. enabled-implementation-guides=ipsum A list of ImplementationGuide URLs in this FHIR store that are used to configure the profiles to use for validation. For example, to use the US Core profiles for validation, set enabled_implementation_guides to [&#34;http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/ImplementationGuide/ig&#34;] . If enabled_implementation_guides is empty or omitted, then incoming resources are only required to conform to the base FHIR profiles. Otherwise, a resource must conform to at least one profile listed in the global property of one of the enabled ImplementationGuides. The Cloud Healthcare API does not currently enforce all of the rules in a StructureDefinition. The following rules are supported: - min/max - minValue/maxValue - maxLength - type - fixed[x] - pattern[x] on simple types - slicing, when using \"value\" as the discriminator type When a URL cannot be resolved (for example, in a type assertion), the server does not return an error. Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. .. version=ipsum Required. Immutable. The FHIR specification version that this FHIR store supports natively. This field is immutable after store creation. Requests are rejected if they contain FHIR resources of a different version. Version is required for every FHIR store. About Cursors The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. . Each additional . moves it up one additional level. E.g. ... would go three levels up. Optional Output Flags The method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default. -o out out specifies the destination to which to write the server's result to. It will be a JSON-encoded structure. The destination may be - to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes. If unset, it defaults to standard output.

About Cursors The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. . Each additional . moves it up one additional level. E.g. ... would go three levels up. Optional Output Flags The method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default. -o out out specifies the destination to which to write the server's result to.

PubsubMessage.PublishTime is the time at which the message was published. Notifications are only sent if the topic is non-empty. Topic names must be scoped to a project. Cloud Healthcare API service account must have publisher permissions on the given Pub/Sub topic. Not having adequate permissions causes the calls that send notifications to fail. If a notification can't be published to Pub/Sub, errors are logged to Cloud Logging (see Viewing error logs in Cloud Logging ). If the number of errors exceeds a certain rate, some aren't submitted.

A duplicate message is a message with the same raw bytes as a message that has already been ingested/created in this HL7v2 store. The default value is false, meaning that the store accepts the duplicate messages and it also returns the same ACK message in the IngestMessageResponse as has been returned previously. Note that only one resource is created in the store. When this field is set to true, CreateMessage/IngestMessage requests with a duplicate message will be rejected by the store, and IngestMessageErrorDetail returns a NACK message upon rejection. About Cursors The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures.

The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. .

If not specified, the time when the export is scheduled is used. This value has to come after the start_time defined below. Only messages whose send_time lies in the range start_time (inclusive) to end_time (exclusive) are exported. filter=accusam Restricts messages exported to those matching a filter, only applicable to PubsubDestination. The following syntax is available: * A string field value can be written as text inside quotation marks, for example &#34;query text&#34; . The only valid relational operation for text fields is equality ( = ), where text is searched within the field, rather than having the field be equal to the text. For example, &#34;Comment = great&#34; returns messages with great in the comment field. * A number field value can be written as an integer, a decimal, or an exponential. The valid relational operators for number fields are the equality operator ( = ), along with the less than/greater than operators ( &lt; , &lt;= , &gt; , &gt;= ). Note that there is no inequality ( != ) operator. You can prepend the NOT operator to an expression to negate it. * A date field value must be written in the yyyy-mm-dd format. Fields with date and time use the RFC3339 time format. Leading zeros are required for one-digit months and days. The valid relational operators for date fields are the equality operator ( = ) , along with the less than/greater than operators ( &lt; , &lt;= , &gt; , &gt;= ). Note that there is no inequality ( != ) operator. You can prepend the NOT operator to an expression to negate it. * Multiple field query expressions can be combined in one query by adding AND or OR operators between the expressions. If a boolean operator appears within a quoted string, it is not treated as special, and is just another part of the character string to be matched. You can prepend the NOT operator to an expression to negate it. The following fields and functions are available for filtering: * message_type , from the MSH-9.1 field. For example, NOT message_type = &#34;ADT&#34; . * send_date or sendDate , the YYYY-MM-DD date the message was sent in the dataset's time_zone, from the MSH-7 segment. For example, send_date &lt; &#34;2017-01-02&#34; . * send_time , the timestamp when the message was sent, using the RFC3339 time format for comparisons, from the MSH-7 segment. For example, send_time &lt; &#34;2017-01-02T00:00:00-05:00&#34; . * create_time , the timestamp when the message was created in the HL7v2 store. Use the RFC3339 time format for comparisons. For example, create_time &lt; &#34;2017-01-02T00:00:00-05:00&#34; . * send_facility , the care center that the message came from, from the MSH-4 segment. For example, send_facility = &#34;ABC&#34; . Note: The filter will be applied to every message in the HL7v2 store whose send_time lies in the range defined by the start_time and the end_time . Even if the filter only matches a small set of messages, the export operation can still take a long time to finish when a lot of messages are between the specified start_time and end_time range. gcs-destination content-structure=et The format of the exported HL7v2 message files. message-view=nonumy Specifies the parts of the Message resource to include in the export.

Only messages whose send_time lies in the range start_time (inclusive) to end_time (exclusive) are exported. filter=accusam Restricts messages exported to those matching a filter, only applicable to PubsubDestination. The following syntax is available: * A string field value can be written as text inside quotation marks, for example &#34;query text&#34; . The only valid relational operation for text fields is equality ( = ), where text is searched within the field, rather than having the field be equal to the text. For example, &#34;Comment = great&#34; returns messages with great in the comment field. * A number field value can be written as an integer, a decimal, or an exponential. The valid relational operators for number fields are the equality operator ( = ), along with the less than/greater than operators ( &lt; , &lt;= , &gt; , &gt;= ). Note that there is no inequality ( != ) operator. You can prepend the NOT operator to an expression to negate it. * A date field value must be written in the yyyy-mm-dd format. Fields with date and time use the RFC3339 time format. Leading zeros are required for one-digit months and days. The valid relational operators for date fields are the equality operator ( = ) , along with the less than/greater than operators ( &lt; , &lt;= , &gt; , &gt;= ). Note that there is no inequality ( != ) operator. You can prepend the NOT operator to an expression to negate it. * Multiple field query expressions can be combined in one query by adding AND or OR operators between the expressions. If a boolean operator appears within a quoted string, it is not treated as special, and is just another part of the character string to be matched. You can prepend the NOT operator to an expression to negate it. The following fields and functions are available for filtering: * message_type , from the MSH-9.1 field. For example, NOT message_type = &#34;ADT&#34; . * send_date or sendDate , the YYYY-MM-DD date the message was sent in the dataset's time_zone, from the MSH-7 segment. For example, send_date &lt; &#34;2017-01-02&#34; . * send_time , the timestamp when the message was sent, using the RFC3339 time format for comparisons, from the MSH-7 segment. For example, send_time &lt; &#34;2017-01-02T00:00:00-05:00&#34; . * create_time , the timestamp when the message was created in the HL7v2 store. Use the RFC3339 time format for comparisons. For example, create_time &lt; &#34;2017-01-02T00:00:00-05:00&#34; . * send_facility , the care center that the message came from, from the MSH-4 segment. For example, send_facility = &#34;ABC&#34; . Note: The filter will be applied to every message in the HL7v2 store whose send_time lies in the range defined by the start_time and the end_time . Even if the filter only matches a small set of messages, the export operation can still take a long time to finish when a lot of messages are between the specified start_time and end_time range. gcs-destination content-structure=et The format of the exported HL7v2 message files. message-view=nonumy Specifies the parts of the Message resource to include in the export.

This method is optimized to load large quantities of data using import semantics that ignore some HL7v2 store configuration options and are not suitable for all use cases. It is primarily intended to load data into an empty HL7v2 store that is not being used by other clients. An existing message will be overwritten if a duplicate message is imported. A duplicate message is a message with the same raw bytes as a message that already exists in this HL7v2 store. When a message is overwritten, its labels will also be overwritten. The import operation is idempotent unless the input data contains multiple valid messages with the same raw bytes but different labels. In that case, after the import completes, the store contains exactly one message with those raw bytes but there is no ordering guarantee on which version of the labels it has. The operation result counters do not count duplicated raw bytes as an error and count one success for each message in the input, which might result in a success count larger than the number of messages in the HL7v2 store. If some messages fail to import, for example due to parsing errors, successfully imported messages are not rolled back. This method returns an Operation that can be used to track the status of the import by calling GetOperation. Immediate fatal errors appear in the error field, errors are also logged to Cloud Logging (see Viewing error logs in Cloud Logging ). Otherwise, when the operation finishes, a response of type ImportMessagesResponse is returned in the response field. The metadata field type for this operation is OperationMetadata.

Each field may be a simple scalar or another data-structure. In the latter case it is advised to set the field-cursor to the data-structure's field to specify values more concisely. For example, a structure like this: ImportMessagesRequest: gcs-source: uri: string can be set completely with the following arguments which are assumed to be executed in the given order. Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time. -r .gcs-source uri=consetetur Points to a Cloud Storage URI containing file(s) to import. The URI must be in the following format: gs://{bucket_id}/{object_id} . The URI can include wildcards in object_id and thus identify multiple files. Supported wildcards: * * to match 0 or more non-separator characters * ** to match 0 or more characters (including separators). Must be used at the end of a path and with no other wildcards in the path. Can also be used with a file extension (such as .ndjson), which imports all files with the extension in the specified directory and its sub-directories. For example, gs://my-bucket/my-directory/**.ndjson imports all files with .ndjson extensions in my-directory/ and its sub-directories. * ? to match 1 character Files matching the wildcard are expected to contain content only, no metadata. About Cursors The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures.

Required Request Value The request value is a data-structure with various fields. Each field may be a simple scalar or another data-structure. In the latter case it is advised to set the field-cursor to the data-structure's field to specify values more concisely. For example, a structure like this: AnalyzeEntitiesRequest: alternative-output-format: string document-content: string licensed-vocabularies: [string] can be set completely with the following arguments which are assumed to be executed in the given order. Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time. -r . alternative-output-format=et Optional. Alternative output format to be generated based on the results of analysis. document-content=eirmod document_content is a document to be annotated. licensed-vocabularies=sed A list of licensed vocabularies to use in the request, in addition to the default unlicensed vocabularies. Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. About Cursors The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly.
