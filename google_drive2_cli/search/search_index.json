By default all output is printed to standard out, but flags can be set to direct it into a file independent of your shell's capabilities. Errors will be printed to standard error, and cause the program's exit code to be non-zero. If data-structures are requested, these will be returned as pretty-printed JSON, to be useful as input to other tools. Everything else about the drive API can be found at the official documentation site . Installation and Source Code Install the command-line interface with cargo using: cargo install google-drive2-cli Find the source code on github .

Each scope requires the user to grant this application permission to use it. If unset, it defaults to the shortest scope url for a particular method. --config-dir <folder> A directory into which we will store our persistent data. Defaults to a user-writable directory that we will create during the first invocation. [default: ~/.google-service-cli] Configuration The program will store all persistent data in the ~/.google-service-cli directory in JSON files prefixed with drive2- . You can change the directory used to store configuration with the --config-dir flag on a per-invocation basis. More information about the various kinds of persistent data are given in the following paragraphs. Authentication Most APIs require a user to authenticate any request. If this is the case, the scope determines the set of permissions granted. The granularity of these is usually no more than read-only or full-access . If not set, the system will automatically select the smallest feasible scope, e.g. when invoking a method that is read-only, it will ask only for a read-only scope. You may use the --scope flag to specify a scope directly. All applicable scopes are documented in the respective method's CLI documentation. The first time a scope is used, the user is asked for permission. Follow the instructions given by the CLI to grant permissions, or to decline. If a scope was authenticated by the user, the respective information will be stored as JSON in the configuration directory, e.g. ~/.google-service-cli/drive2-token-<scope-hash>.json . No manual management of these tokens is necessary. To revoke granted authentication, please refer to the official documentation . Application Secrets In order to allow any application to use Google services, it will need to be registered using the Google Developer Console . APIs the application may use are then enabled for it one by one. Most APIs can be used for free and have a daily quota. To allow more comfortable usage of the CLI without forcing anyone to register an own application, the CLI comes with a default application secret that is configured accordingly. This also means that heavy usage all around the world may deplete the daily quota. You can workaround this limitation by putting your own secrets file at this location: ~/.google-service-cli/drive2-secret.json , assuming that the required drive API was enabled for it. Such a secret file can be downloaded in the Google Developer Console at APIs & auth -> Credentials -> Download JSON and used as is. Learn more about how to setup Google projects and enable APIs using the official documentation . Debugging Even though the CLI does its best to provide usable error messages, sometimes it might be desirable to know what exactly led to a particular issue. This is done by allowing all client-server communication to be output to standard error as-is . The --debug flag will print errors using the Debug representation to standard error. You may consider redirecting standard error into a file for ease of use, e.g. drive2 --debug <resource> <method> [options] 2>debug.txt .","title":"Home"},{"location":"#installation-and-source-code","text":"Install the command-line interface with cargo using: cargo install google-drive2-cli Find the source code on github .","title":"Installation and Source Code"},{"location":"#usage","text":"This documentation was generated from the drive API at revision 20240227 .

The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. .

The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. . Each additional . moves it up one additional level. E.g. ... would go three levels up. Optional Output Flags The method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default. -o out out specifies the destination to which to write the server's result to.

This method supports an /upload URI and accepts uploaded media with the following characteristics: - Maximum file size: 5,120 GB - Accepted Media MIME types: */* Note: Specify a valid MIME type, rather than the literal */* value. The literal */* is only used to indicate that any valid MIME type can be uploaded. For more information on uploading files, see Upload file data . Apps creating shortcuts with files.insert must specify the MIME type application/vnd.google-apps.shortcut . Apps should specify a file extension in the title property when inserting files with the API. For example, an operation to insert a JPEG file should specify something like &#34;title&#34;: &#34;cat.jpg&#34; in the metadata. Subsequent GET requests include the read-only fileExtension property populated with the extension originally specified in the title property. When a Google Drive user requests to download a file, or when the file is downloaded through the sync client, Drive builds a full filename (with extension) based on the title. In cases where the extension is missing, Drive attempts to determine the extension based on the file's MIME type.

The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. . Each additional . moves it up one additional level. E.g. ... would go three levels up. Required Upload Flags This method supports the upload of data, which requires all of the following flags to be set: -u simple simple - Upload media all at once. -f file Path to file to upload.

The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. . Each additional . moves it up one additional level. E.g. ... would go three levels up. Optional Output Flags The method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default. -o out out specifies the destination to which to write the server's result to.

The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. . Each additional . moves it up one additional level. E.g. ... would go three levels up.

About Cursors The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. .

Required Scalar Argument <request-id> (string) Required. An ID, such as a random UUID, which uniquely identifies this user's request for idempotent creation of a Team Drive. A repeated request by the same user and with the same request ID will avoid creating duplicates by attempting to create the same Team Drive. If the Team Drive already exists a 409 error will be returned. Required Request Value The request value is a data-structure with various fields. Each field may be a simple scalar or another data-structure. In the latter case it is advised to set the field-cursor to the data-structure's field to specify values more concisely.

When this restriction is set to true , it will override the similarly named field to true for any file inside this Team Drive. domain-users-only=true Whether access to this Team Drive and items inside this Team Drive is restricted to users of the domain to which this Team Drive belongs. This restriction may be overridden by other sharing policies controlled outside of this Team Drive. sharing-folders-requires-organizer-permission=false If true, only users with the organizer role can share folders. If false, users with either the organizer role or the file organizer role can share folders. team-members-only=false Whether access to items inside this Team Drive is restricted to members of this Team Drive. .. theme-id=takimata The ID of the theme from which the background image and color will be set. The set of possible teamDriveThemes can be retrieved from a drive.about.get response. When not specified on a drive.teamdrives.insert request, a random theme is chosen from which the background image and color are set. This is a write-only field; it can only be set on requests that don't set colorRgb or backgroundImageFile . About Cursors The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. . Each additional . moves it up one additional level. E.g. ... would go three levels up.

For example, a structure like this: TeamDrive: background-image-file: id: string width: number x-coordinate: number y-coordinate: number background-image-link: string capabilities: can-add-children: boolean can-change-copy-requires-writer-permission-restriction: boolean can-change-domain-users-only-restriction: boolean can-change-sharing-folders-requires-organizer-permission-restriction: boolean can-change-team-drive-background: boolean can-change-team-members-only-restriction: boolean can-comment: boolean can-copy: boolean can-delete-children: boolean can-delete-team-drive: boolean can-download: boolean can-edit: boolean can-list-children: boolean can-manage-members: boolean can-read-revisions: boolean can-remove-children: boolean can-rename: boolean can-rename-team-drive: boolean can-reset-team-drive-restrictions: boolean can-share: boolean can-trash-children: boolean color-rgb: string created-date: string id: string kind: string name: string org-unit-id: string restrictions: admin-managed-restrictions: boolean copy-requires-writer-permission: boolean domain-users-only: boolean sharing-folders-requires-organizer-permission: boolean team-members-only: boolean theme-id: string can be set completely with the following arguments which are assumed to be executed in the given order. Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time. -r .background-image-file id=labore The ID of an image file in Drive to use for the background image. width=0.7548460781084456 The width of the cropped image in the closed range of 0 to 1. This value represents the width of the cropped image divided by the width of the entire image. The height is computed by applying a width to height aspect ratio of 80 to 9. The resulting image must be at least 1280 pixels wide and 144 pixels high. x-coordinate=0.1437961259570123 The X coordinate of the upper left corner of the cropping area in the background image. This is a value in the closed range of 0 to 1. This value represents the horizontal distance from the left side of the entire image to the left side of the cropping area divided by the width of the entire image. y-coordinate=0.4445619778136626 The Y coordinate of the upper left corner of the cropping area in the background image. This is a value in the closed range of 0 to 1. This value represents the vertical distance from the top side of the entire image to the top side of the cropping area divided by the height of the entire image. .. background-image-link=accusam A short-lived link to this Team Drive's background image. capabilities can-add-children=false Whether the current user can add children to folders in this Team Drive. can-change-copy-requires-writer-permission-restriction=false Whether the current user can change the copyRequiresWriterPermission restriction of this Team Drive. can-change-domain-users-only-restriction=false Whether the current user can change the domainUsersOnly restriction of this Team Drive. can-change-sharing-folders-requires-organizer-permission-restriction=false Whether the current user can change the sharingFoldersRequiresOrganizerPermission restriction of this Team Drive. can-change-team-drive-background=false Whether the current user can change the background of this Team Drive. can-change-team-members-only-restriction=false Whether the current user can change the teamMembersOnly restriction of this Team Drive. can-comment=true Whether the current user can comment on files in this Team Drive. can-copy=true Whether the current user can copy files in this Team Drive. can-delete-children=true Whether the current user can delete children from folders in this Team Drive. can-delete-team-drive=false Whether the current user can delete this Team Drive. Attempting to delete the Team Drive may still fail if there are untrashed items inside the Team Drive. can-download=false Whether the current user can download files in this Team Drive. can-edit=true Whether the current user can edit files in this Team Drive can-list-children=true Whether the current user can list the children of folders in this Team Drive. can-manage-members=true Whether the current user can add members to this Team Drive or remove them or change their role. can-read-revisions=true Whether the current user can read the revisions resource of files in this Team Drive. can-remove-children=true Deprecated: Use canDeleteChildren or canTrashChildren instead. can-rename=false Whether the current user can rename files or folders in this Team Drive. can-rename-team-drive=false Whether the current user can rename this Team Drive. can-reset-team-drive-restrictions=true Whether the current user can reset the Team Drive restrictions to defaults. can-share=false Whether the current user can share files or folders in this Team Drive. can-trash-children=true Whether the current user can trash children from folders in this Team Drive. .. color-rgb=ea The color of this Team Drive as an RGB hex string. It can only be set on a drive.teamdrives.update request that does not set themeId . created-date=et The time at which the Team Drive was created (RFC 3339 date-time). id=kasd The ID of this Team Drive which is also the ID of the top level folder of this Team Drive. kind=vero This is always drive#teamDrive name=sanctus The name of this Team Drive. org-unit-id=dolore The organizational unit of this shared drive. This field is only populated on drives.list responses when the useDomainAdminAccess parameter is set to true . restrictions admin-managed-restrictions=true Whether administrative privileges on this Team Drive are required to modify restrictions. copy-requires-writer-permission=true Whether the options to copy, print, or download files inside this Team Drive, should be disabled for readers and commenters. When this restriction is set to true , it will override the similarly named field to true for any file inside this Team Drive. domain-users-only=true Whether access to this Team Drive and items inside this Team Drive is restricted to users of the domain to which this Team Drive belongs. This restriction may be overridden by other sharing policies controlled outside of this Team Drive. sharing-folders-requires-organizer-permission=false If true, only users with the organizer role can share folders. If false, users with either the organizer role or the file organizer role can share folders. team-members-only=false Whether access to items inside this Team Drive is restricted to members of this Team Drive. .. theme-id=eos The ID of the theme from which the background image and color will be set. The set of possible teamDriveThemes can be retrieved from a drive.about.get response. When not specified on a drive.teamdrives.insert request, a random theme is chosen from which the background image and color are set. This is a write-only field; it can only be set on requests that don't set colorRgb or backgroundImageFile . About Cursors The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. . Each additional . moves it up one additional level. E.g. ... would go three levels up. Optional Output Flags The method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default. -o out out specifies the destination to which to write the server's result to. It will be a JSON-encoded structure. The destination may be - to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes. If unset, it defaults to standard output. Optional Method Properties You may set the following properties to further configure the call. Please note that -p is followed by one or more key-value-pairs, and is called like this -p k1=v1 k2=v2 even though the listing below repeats the -p for completeness. -p use-domain-admin-access=boolean Issue the request as a domain administrator; if set to true, then the requester will be granted access if they are an administrator of the domain to which the Team Drive belongs. Optional General Properties The following properties can configure any call, and are not specific to this method. -p $-xgafv=string V1 error format. -p access-token=string OAuth access token. -p alt=string Data format for response. -p callback=string JSONP -p fields=string Selector specifying which fields to include in a partial response. -p key=string API key.
