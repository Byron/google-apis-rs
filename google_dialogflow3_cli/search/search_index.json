By default all output is printed to standard out, but flags can be set to direct it into a file independent of your shell's capabilities. Errors will be printed to standard error, and cause the program's exit code to be non-zero. If data-structures are requested, these will be returned as pretty-printed JSON, to be useful as input to other tools. Everything else about the Dialogflow API can be found at the official documentation site . Installation and Source Code Install the command-line interface with cargo using: cargo install google-dialogflow3-cli Find the source code on github .

Each scope requires the user to grant this application permission to use it. If unset, it defaults to the shortest scope url for a particular method. --config-dir <folder> A directory into which we will store our persistent data. Defaults to a user-writable directory that we will create during the first invocation. [default: ~/.google-service-cli] Configuration The program will store all persistent data in the ~/.google-service-cli directory in JSON files prefixed with dialogflow3- . You can change the directory used to store configuration with the --config-dir flag on a per-invocation basis. More information about the various kinds of persistent data are given in the following paragraphs. Authentication Most APIs require a user to authenticate any request. If this is the case, the scope determines the set of permissions granted. The granularity of these is usually no more than read-only or full-access . If not set, the system will automatically select the smallest feasible scope, e.g. when invoking a method that is read-only, it will ask only for a read-only scope. You may use the --scope flag to specify a scope directly. All applicable scopes are documented in the respective method's CLI documentation. The first time a scope is used, the user is asked for permission. Follow the instructions given by the CLI to grant permissions, or to decline. If a scope was authenticated by the user, the respective information will be stored as JSON in the configuration directory, e.g. ~/.google-service-cli/dialogflow3-token-<scope-hash>.json . No manual management of these tokens is necessary. To revoke granted authentication, please refer to the official documentation . Application Secrets In order to allow any application to use Google services, it will need to be registered using the Google Developer Console . APIs the application may use are then enabled for it one by one. Most APIs can be used for free and have a daily quota. To allow more comfortable usage of the CLI without forcing anyone to register an own application, the CLI comes with a default application secret that is configured accordingly. This also means that heavy usage all around the world may deplete the daily quota. You can workaround this limitation by putting your own secrets file at this location: ~/.google-service-cli/dialogflow3-secret.json , assuming that the required dialogflow API was enabled for it. Such a secret file can be downloaded in the Google Developer Console at APIs & auth -> Credentials -> Download JSON and used as is. Learn more about how to setup Google projects and enable APIs using the official documentation . Debugging Even though the CLI does its best to provide usable error messages, sometimes it might be desirable to know what exactly led to a particular issue. This is done by allowing all client-server communication to be output to standard error as-is . The --debug flag will print errors using the Debug representation to standard error. You may consider redirecting standard error into a file for ease of use, e.g. dialogflow3 --debug <resource> <method> [options] 2>debug.txt .","title":"Home"},{"location":"#installation-and-source-code","text":"Install the command-line interface with cargo using: cargo install google-dialogflow3-cli Find the source code on github .","title":"Installation and Source Code"},{"location":"#usage","text":"This documentation was generated from the Dialogflow API at revision 20240227 .

If this is the case, the scope determines the set of permissions granted. The granularity of these is usually no more than read-only or full-access . If not set, the system will automatically select the smallest feasible scope, e.g. when invoking a method that is read-only, it will ask only for a read-only scope. You may use the --scope flag to specify a scope directly. All applicable scopes are documented in the respective method's CLI documentation. The first time a scope is used, the user is asked for permission. Follow the instructions given by the CLI to grant permissions, or to decline. If a scope was authenticated by the user, the respective information will be stored as JSON in the configuration directory, e.g. ~/.google-service-cli/dialogflow3-token-<scope-hash>.json .

This also means that heavy usage all around the world may deplete the daily quota. You can workaround this limitation by putting your own secrets file at this location: ~/.google-service-cli/dialogflow3-secret.json , assuming that the required dialogflow API was enabled for it.

Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time. -r .entity-types-content content=vero The uncompressed byte content for the objects. .. entity-types-uri=erat The Google Cloud Storage URI to import entity types from. The format of this URI must be gs:/// . Dialogflow performs a read operation for the Cloud Storage object on the caller's behalf, so your request authentication must have read permissions for the object.

Format: projects//locations//agents//entity_types/ . If set, there should be only one entity type included in entity_types, of which the type should match the type of the target entity type.

The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly.

For more information, see Speech models . model-variant=est Optional. Which variant of the Speech model to use. opt-out-conformer-model-migration=false If true , the request will opt out for STT conformer model migration. This field will be deprecated once force migration takes place in June 2024. Please refer to Dialogflow CX Speech model migration . phrase-hints=consetetur Optional. A list of strings containing words and phrases that the speech recognizer should recognize with higher likelihood. See the Cloud Speech documentation for more details. Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. sample-rate-hertz=36 Sample rate (in Hertz) of the audio content sent in the query. Refer to Cloud Speech API documentation for more details. single-utterance=false Optional. If false (default), recognition does not cease until the client closes the stream. If true , the recognizer will detect a single spoken utterance in input audio. Recognition ceases when it detects the audio's voice has stopped or paused. In this case, once a detected intent is received, the client should close the stream and start a new request with a new stream as needed. Note: This setting is relevant only for streaming methods. ...dtmf digits=elitr The dtmf digits. finish-digit=duo The finish digit (if any). ..event event=diam Name of the event. ..intent intent=est Required. The unique identifier of the intent. Format: projects//locations//agents//intents/ . .. language-code=sit Required. The language of the input.

A list of strings containing words and phrases that the speech recognizer should recognize with higher likelihood. See the Cloud Speech documentation for more details. Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. sample-rate-hertz=36 Sample rate (in Hertz) of the audio content sent in the query. Refer to Cloud Speech API documentation for more details. single-utterance=false Optional. If false (default), recognition does not cease until the client closes the stream. If true , the recognizer will detect a single spoken utterance in input audio. Recognition ceases when it detects the audio's voice has stopped or paused. In this case, once a detected intent is received, the client should close the stream and start a new request with a new stream as needed. Note: This setting is relevant only for streaming methods. ...dtmf digits=elitr The dtmf digits. finish-digit=duo The finish digit (if any). ..event event=diam Name of the event. ..intent intent=est Required. The unique identifier of the intent. Format: projects//locations//agents//intents/ . .. language-code=sit Required. The language of the input. See Language Support for a list of the currently supported language codes. Note that queries in the same session do not necessarily need to specify the same language. text text=sed Required. The UTF-8 encoded natural language text to be processed. ...query-params analyze-query-text-sentiment=false Configures whether sentiment analysis should be performed. If not provided, sentiment analysis is not performed. channel=lorem The channel which this query is for. If specified, only the ResponseMessage associated with the channel will be returned. If no ResponseMessage is associated with the channel, it falls back to the ResponseMessage with unspecified channel. If unspecified, the ResponseMessage with unspecified channel will be returned. current-page=ea The unique identifier of the page to override the current page in the session. Format: projects//locations//agents//flows//pages/ . If current_page is specified, the previous state of the session will be ignored by Dialogflow, including the previous page and the previous session parameters. In most cases, current_page and parameters should be configured together to direct a session to a specific state. disable-webhook=true Whether to disable webhook calls for this request. flow-versions=sea A list of flow versions to override for the request. Format: projects//locations//agents//flows//versions/ . If version 1 of flow X is included in this list, the traffic of flow X will go through version 1 regardless of the version configuration in the environment. Each flow can have at most one version specified in this list. Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. geo-location latitude=0.2137526511514316 The latitude in degrees. It must be in the range [-90.0, +90.0]. longitude=0.13613238546301754 The longitude in degrees. It must be in the range [-180.0, +180.0]. .. session-ttl=lorem Optional. Configure lifetime of the Dialogflow session. By default, a Dialogflow session remains active and its data is stored for 30 minutes after the last request is sent for the session. This value should be no longer than 1 day. time-zone=accusam The time zone of this conversational query from the time zone database , e.g., America/New_York, Europe/Paris. If not provided, the time zone specified in the agent is used. webhook-headers=key=amet This field can be used to pass HTTP headers for a webhook call. These headers will be sent to webhook along with the headers that have been configured through Dialogflow web console. The headers defined within this field will overwrite the headers configured through Dialogflow console if there is a conflict. Header names are case-insensitive. Google's specified headers are not allowed.

If not provided, the time zone specified in the agent is used. webhook-headers=key=lorem This field can be used to pass HTTP headers for a webhook call. These headers will be sent to webhook along with the headers that have been configured through Dialogflow web console. The headers defined within this field will overwrite the headers configured through Dialogflow console if there is a conflict. Header names are case-insensitive. Google's specified headers are not allowed. Including: \"Host\", \"Content-Length\", \"Connection\", \"From\", \"User-Agent\", \"Accept-Encoding\", \"If-Modified-Since\", \"If-None-Match\", \"X-Forwarded-For\", etc. the value will be associated with the given key ...output-audio-config audio-encoding=justo Required. Audio encoding of the synthesized audio content. sample-rate-hertz=49 Optional. The synthesis sample rate (in hertz) for this audio. If not provided, then the synthesizer will use the default sample rate based on the audio encoding. If this is different from the voice's natural sample rate, then the synthesizer will honor this request by converting to the desired sample rate (which might result in worse audio quality). synthesize-speech-config effects-profile-id=no Optional. An identifier which selects 'audio effects' profiles that are applied on (post synthesized) text to speech. Effects are applied on top of each other in the order they are given. Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. pitch=0.08583127305487803 Optional. Speaking pitch, in the range [-20.0, 20.0]. 20 means increase 20 semitones from the original pitch. -20 means decrease 20 semitones from the original pitch. speaking-rate=0.6940359249925465 Optional. Speaking rate/speed, in the range [0.25, 4.0]. 1.0 is the normal native speed supported by the specific voice. 2.0 is twice as fast, and 0.5 is half as fast. If unset(0.0), defaults to the native 1.0 speed. Any other values < 0.25 or > 4.0 will return an error. voice name=sanctus Optional. The name of the voice. If not set, the service will choose a voice based on the other parameters such as language_code and ssml_gender. For the list of available voices, please refer to Supported voices and languages . ssml-gender=nonumy Optional. The preferred gender of the voice. If not set, the service will choose a voice based on the other parameters such as language_code and name. Note that this is only a preference, not requirement. If a voice of the appropriate gender is not available, the synthesizer substitutes a voice with a different gender rather than failing the request. .. volume-gain-db=0.841261088339696 Optional. Volume gain (in dB) of the normal native volume supported by the specific voice, in the range [-96.0, 16.0]. If unset, or set to a value of 0.0 (dB), will play at normal native signal amplitude. A value of -6.0 (dB) will play at approximately half the amplitude of the normal native signal amplitude. A value of +6.0 (dB) will play at approximately twice the amplitude of the normal native signal amplitude. We strongly recommend not to exceed +10 (dB) as there's usually no effective increase in loudness for any value greater than that. About Cursors The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. .

Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time. -r .output-audio-config audio-encoding=sit Required. Audio encoding of the synthesized audio content. sample-rate-hertz=75 Optional. The synthesis sample rate (in hertz) for this audio. If not provided, then the synthesizer will use the default sample rate based on the audio encoding. If this is different from the voice's natural sample rate, then the synthesizer will honor this request by converting to the desired sample rate (which might result in worse audio quality). synthesize-speech-config effects-profile-id=rebum. Optional. An identifier which selects 'audio effects' profiles that are applied on (post synthesized) text to speech. Effects are applied on top of each other in the order they are given. Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. pitch=0.6442332270981633 Optional. Speaking pitch, in the range [-20.0, 20.0]. 20 means increase 20 semitones from the original pitch. -20 means decrease 20 semitones from the original pitch. speaking-rate=0.6411045160922014 Optional. Speaking rate/speed, in the range [0.25, 4.0]. 1.0 is the normal native speed supported by the specific voice. 2.0 is twice as fast, and 0.5 is half as fast. If unset(0.0), defaults to the native 1.0 speed. Any other values < 0.25 or > 4.0 will return an error. voice name=invidunt Optional. The name of the voice. If not set, the service will choose a voice based on the other parameters such as language_code and ssml_gender. For the list of available voices, please refer to Supported voices and languages . ssml-gender=clita Optional. The preferred gender of the voice. If not set, the service will choose a voice based on the other parameters such as language_code and name. Note that this is only a preference, not requirement. If a voice of the appropriate gender is not available, the synthesizer substitutes a voice with a different gender rather than failing the request. .. volume-gain-db=0.015843876813973368 Optional. Volume gain (in dB) of the normal native volume supported by the specific voice, in the range [-96.0, 16.0]. If unset, or set to a value of 0.0 (dB), will play at normal native signal amplitude. A value of -6.0 (dB) will play at approximately half the amplitude of the normal native signal amplitude. A value of +6.0 (dB) will play at approximately twice the amplitude of the normal native signal amplitude. We strongly recommend not to exceed +10 (dB) as there's usually no effective increase in loudness for any value greater than that. ...query-input.audio audio=magna The natural language speech audio to be processed. A single request can contain up to 2 minutes of speech audio data. The transcribed text cannot contain more than 256 bytes.

If false or unspecified, Speech doesn't return any word-level information. model=sed Optional. Which Speech model to select for the given request. For more information, see Speech models . model-variant=est Optional. Which variant of the Speech model to use. opt-out-conformer-model-migration=false If true , the request will opt out for STT conformer model migration. This field will be deprecated once force migration takes place in June 2024. Please refer to Dialogflow CX Speech model migration . phrase-hints=diam Optional. A list of strings containing words and phrases that the speech recognizer should recognize with higher likelihood. See the Cloud Speech documentation for more details. Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. sample-rate-hertz=24 Sample rate (in Hertz) of the audio content sent in the query. Refer to Cloud Speech API documentation for more details. single-utterance=false Optional. If false (default), recognition does not cease until the client closes the stream. If true , the recognizer will detect a single spoken utterance in input audio. Recognition ceases when it detects the audio's voice has stopped or paused. In this case, once a detected intent is received, the client should close the stream and start a new request with a new stream as needed. Note: This setting is relevant only for streaming methods. ...dtmf digits=justo The dtmf digits. finish-digit=ipsum The finish digit (if any). ..event event=accusam Name of the event. ..intent intent=dolores Required. The unique identifier of the intent. Format: projects//locations//agents//intents/ . .. language-code=consetetur Required. The language of the input.

If this is different from the voice's natural sample rate, then the synthesizer will honor this request by converting to the desired sample rate (which might result in worse audio quality). synthesize-speech-config effects-profile-id=eirmod Optional. An identifier which selects 'audio effects' profiles that are applied on (post synthesized) text to speech. Effects are applied on top of each other in the order they are given. Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. pitch=0.6422483094050018 Optional. Speaking pitch, in the range [-20.0, 20.0]. 20 means increase 20 semitones from the original pitch. -20 means decrease 20 semitones from the original pitch. speaking-rate=0.5410228726160051 Optional. Speaking rate/speed, in the range [0.25, 4.0]. 1.0 is the normal native speed supported by the specific voice. 2.0 is twice as fast, and 0.5 is half as fast. If unset(0.0), defaults to the native 1.0 speed. Any other values < 0.25 or > 4.0 will return an error. voice name=vero Optional. The name of the voice. If not set, the service will choose a voice based on the other parameters such as language_code and ssml_gender. For the list of available voices, please refer to Supported voices and languages . ssml-gender=ea Optional. The preferred gender of the voice. If not set, the service will choose a voice based on the other parameters such as language_code and name. Note that this is only a preference, not requirement. If a voice of the appropriate gender is not available, the synthesizer substitutes a voice with a different gender rather than failing the request. .. volume-gain-db=0.5359622782132828 Optional. Volume gain (in dB) of the normal native volume supported by the specific voice, in the range [-96.0, 16.0]. If unset, or set to a value of 0.0 (dB), will play at normal native signal amplitude. A value of -6.0 (dB) will play at approximately half the amplitude of the normal native signal amplitude. A value of +6.0 (dB) will play at approximately twice the amplitude of the normal native signal amplitude. We strongly recommend not to exceed +10 (dB) as there's usually no effective increase in loudness for any value greater than that. ...query-input.audio audio=amet The natural language speech audio to be processed. A single request can contain up to 2 minutes of speech audio data. The transcribed text cannot contain more than 256 bytes.

If true , Dialogflow returns SpeechWordInfo in StreamingRecognitionResult with information about the recognized speech words, e.g. start and end time offsets. If false or unspecified, Speech doesn't return any word-level information. model=invidunt Optional. Which Speech model to select for the given request. For more information, see Speech models . model-variant=invidunt Optional. Which variant of the Speech model to use. opt-out-conformer-model-migration=true If true , the request will opt out for STT conformer model migration. This field will be deprecated once force migration takes place in June 2024. Please refer to Dialogflow CX Speech model migration . phrase-hints=sed Optional. A list of strings containing words and phrases that the speech recognizer should recognize with higher likelihood. See the Cloud Speech documentation for more details. Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. sample-rate-hertz=76 Sample rate (in Hertz) of the audio content sent in the query. Refer to Cloud Speech API documentation for more details. single-utterance=true Optional. If false (default), recognition does not cease until the client closes the stream. If true , the recognizer will detect a single spoken utterance in input audio. Recognition ceases when it detects the audio's voice has stopped or paused. In this case, once a detected intent is received, the client should close the stream and start a new request with a new stream as needed. Note: This setting is relevant only for streaming methods. ...dtmf digits=et The dtmf digits. finish-digit=ea The finish digit (if any). ..event event=dolor Name of the event. ..intent intent=sadipscing Required. The unique identifier of the intent. Format: projects//locations//agents//intents/ . .. language-code=diam Required. The language of the input. See Language Support for a list of the currently supported language codes. Note that queries in the same session do not necessarily need to specify the same language. text text=at Required. The UTF-8 encoded natural language text to be processed. ...query-params analyze-query-text-sentiment=false Configures whether sentiment analysis should be performed. If not provided, sentiment analysis is not performed. channel=kasd The channel which this query is for. If specified, only the ResponseMessage associated with the channel will be returned. If no ResponseMessage is associated with the channel, it falls back to the ResponseMessage with unspecified channel. If unspecified, the ResponseMessage with unspecified channel will be returned. current-page=magna The unique identifier of the page to override the current page in the session. Format: projects//locations//agents//flows//pages/ . If current_page is specified, the previous state of the session will be ignored by Dialogflow, including the previous page and the previous session parameters. In most cases, current_page and parameters should be configured together to direct a session to a specific state. disable-webhook=true Whether to disable webhook calls for this request. flow-versions=est A list of flow versions to override for the request. Format: projects//locations//agents//flows//versions/ . If version 1 of flow X is included in this list, the traffic of flow X will go through version 1 regardless of the version configuration in the environment.

If this is different from the voice's natural sample rate, then the synthesizer will honor this request by converting to the desired sample rate (which might result in worse audio quality). synthesize-speech-config effects-profile-id=eirmod Optional. An identifier which selects 'audio effects' profiles that are applied on (post synthesized) text to speech. Effects are applied on top of each other in the order they are given. Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. pitch=0.6422483094050018 Optional. Speaking pitch, in the range [-20.0, 20.0]. 20 means increase 20 semitones from the original pitch. -20 means decrease 20 semitones from the original pitch. speaking-rate=0.5410228726160051 Optional. Speaking rate/speed, in the range [0.25, 4.0]. 1.0 is the normal native speed supported by the specific voice. 2.0 is twice as fast, and 0.5 is half as fast. If unset(0.0), defaults to the native 1.0 speed. Any other values < 0.25 or > 4.0 will return an error. voice name=vero Optional. The name of the voice. If not set, the service will choose a voice based on the other parameters such as language_code and ssml_gender. For the list of available voices, please refer to Supported voices and languages . ssml-gender=ea Optional. The preferred gender of the voice. If not set, the service will choose a voice based on the other parameters such as language_code and name. Note that this is only a preference, not requirement. If a voice of the appropriate gender is not available, the synthesizer substitutes a voice with a different gender rather than failing the request. .. volume-gain-db=0.5359622782132828 Optional. Volume gain (in dB) of the normal native volume supported by the specific voice, in the range [-96.0, 16.0]. If unset, or set to a value of 0.0 (dB), will play at normal native signal amplitude. A value of -6.0 (dB) will play at approximately half the amplitude of the normal native signal amplitude. A value of +6.0 (dB) will play at approximately twice the amplitude of the normal native signal amplitude. We strongly recommend not to exceed +10 (dB) as there's usually no effective increase in loudness for any value greater than that. ...query-input.audio audio=amet The natural language speech audio to be processed. A single request can contain up to 2 minutes of speech audio data. The transcribed text cannot contain more than 256 bytes. For non-streaming audio detect intent, both config and audio must be provided. For streaming audio detect intent, config must be provided in the first request and audio must be provided in all following requests. config audio-encoding=sea Required. Audio encoding of the audio content to process. barge-in-config no-barge-in-duration=sadipscing Duration that is not eligible for barge-in at the beginning of the input audio. total-duration=dolore Total duration for the playback at the beginning of the input audio. .. enable-word-info=true Optional. If true , Dialogflow returns SpeechWordInfo in StreamingRecognitionResult with information about the recognized speech words, e.g. start and end time offsets. If false or unspecified, Speech doesn't return any word-level information. model=invidunt Optional. Which Speech model to select for the given request. For more information, see Speech models . model-variant=invidunt Optional. Which variant of the Speech model to use. opt-out-conformer-model-migration=true If true , the request will opt out for STT conformer model migration. This field will be deprecated once force migration takes place in June 2024. Please refer to Dialogflow CX Speech model migration . phrase-hints=sed Optional. A list of strings containing words and phrases that the speech recognizer should recognize with higher likelihood. See the Cloud Speech documentation for more details. Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. sample-rate-hertz=76 Sample rate (in Hertz) of the audio content sent in the query. Refer to Cloud Speech API documentation for more details. single-utterance=true Optional. If false (default), recognition does not cease until the client closes the stream. If true , the recognizer will detect a single spoken utterance in input audio. Recognition ceases when it detects the audio's voice has stopped or paused. In this case, once a detected intent is received, the client should close the stream and start a new request with a new stream as needed. Note: This setting is relevant only for streaming methods. ...dtmf digits=et The dtmf digits. finish-digit=ea The finish digit (if any). ..event event=dolor Name of the event. ..intent intent=sadipscing Required. The unique identifier of the intent. Format: projects//locations//agents//intents/ . .. language-code=diam Required. The language of the input. See Language Support for a list of the currently supported language codes. Note that queries in the same session do not necessarily need to specify the same language. text text=at Required. The UTF-8 encoded natural language text to be processed. ...query-params analyze-query-text-sentiment=false Configures whether sentiment analysis should be performed. If not provided, sentiment analysis is not performed. channel=kasd The channel which this query is for. If specified, only the ResponseMessage associated with the channel will be returned. If no ResponseMessage is associated with the channel, it falls back to the ResponseMessage with unspecified channel. If unspecified, the ResponseMessage with unspecified channel will be returned. current-page=magna The unique identifier of the page to override the current page in the session. Format: projects//locations//agents//flows//pages/ . If current_page is specified, the previous state of the session will be ignored by Dialogflow, including the previous page and the previous session parameters. In most cases, current_page and parameters should be configured together to direct a session to a specific state. disable-webhook=true Whether to disable webhook calls for this request. flow-versions=est A list of flow versions to override for the request. Format: projects//locations//agents//flows//versions/ . If version 1 of flow X is included in this list, the traffic of flow X will go through version 1 regardless of the version configuration in the environment. Each flow can have at most one version specified in this list. Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. geo-location latitude=0.31037327056909825 The latitude in degrees. It must be in the range [-90.0, +90.0]. longitude=0.7942152062428308 The longitude in degrees. It must be in the range [-180.0, +180.0]. .. session-ttl=tempor Optional. Configure lifetime of the Dialogflow session. By default, a Dialogflow session remains active and its data is stored for 30 minutes after the last request is sent for the session. This value should be no longer than 1 day. time-zone=stet The time zone of this conversational query from the time zone database , e.g., America/New_York, Europe/Paris. If not provided, the time zone specified in the agent is used. webhook-headers=key=accusam This field can be used to pass HTTP headers for a webhook call. These headers will be sent to webhook along with the headers that have been configured through Dialogflow web console. The headers defined within this field will overwrite the headers configured through Dialogflow console if there is a conflict. Header names are case-insensitive. Google's specified headers are not allowed.

Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. sample-rate-hertz=12 Sample rate (in Hertz) of the audio content sent in the query. Refer to Cloud Speech API documentation for more details. single-utterance=false Optional. If false (default), recognition does not cease until the client closes the stream. If true , the recognizer will detect a single spoken utterance in input audio. Recognition ceases when it detects the audio's voice has stopped or paused. In this case, once a detected intent is received, the client should close the stream and start a new request with a new stream as needed. Note: This setting is relevant only for streaming methods. ...dtmf digits=et The dtmf digits. finish-digit=est The finish digit (if any). ..event event=stet Name of the event. ..intent intent=dolor Required. The unique identifier of the intent. Format: projects//locations//agents//intents/ . .. language-code=et Required. The language of the input.

This value should be no longer than 1 day. time-zone=erat The time zone of this conversational query from the time zone database , e.g., America/New_York, Europe/Paris. If not provided, the time zone specified in the agent is used. webhook-headers=key=dolor This field can be used to pass HTTP headers for a webhook call. These headers will be sent to webhook along with the headers that have been configured through Dialogflow web console. The headers defined within this field will overwrite the headers configured through Dialogflow console if there is a conflict. Header names are case-insensitive. Google's specified headers are not allowed. Including: \"Host\", \"Content-Length\", \"Connection\", \"From\", \"User-Agent\", \"Accept-Encoding\", \"If-Modified-Since\", \"If-None-Match\", \"X-Forwarded-For\", etc. the value will be associated with the given key ...output-audio-config audio-encoding=amet. Required. Audio encoding of the synthesized audio content. sample-rate-hertz=38 Optional. The synthesis sample rate (in hertz) for this audio. If not provided, then the synthesizer will use the default sample rate based on the audio encoding. If this is different from the voice's natural sample rate, then the synthesizer will honor this request by converting to the desired sample rate (which might result in worse audio quality). synthesize-speech-config effects-profile-id=eirmod Optional. An identifier which selects 'audio effects' profiles that are applied on (post synthesized) text to speech. Effects are applied on top of each other in the order they are given. Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. pitch=0.3850966597070734 Optional. Speaking pitch, in the range [-20.0, 20.0]. 20 means increase 20 semitones from the original pitch. -20 means decrease 20 semitones from the original pitch. speaking-rate=0.3881186367850509 Optional. Speaking rate/speed, in the range [0.25, 4.0]. 1.0 is the normal native speed supported by the specific voice. 2.0 is twice as fast, and 0.5 is half as fast. If unset(0.0), defaults to the native 1.0 speed. Any other values < 0.25 or > 4.0 will return an error. voice name=labore Optional. The name of the voice. If not set, the service will choose a voice based on the other parameters such as language_code and ssml_gender. For the list of available voices, please refer to Supported voices and languages . ssml-gender=sed Optional. The preferred gender of the voice. If not set, the service will choose a voice based on the other parameters such as language_code and name. Note that this is only a preference, not requirement. If a voice of the appropriate gender is not available, the synthesizer substitutes a voice with a different gender rather than failing the request. .. volume-gain-db=0.7672121825109711 Optional. Volume gain (in dB) of the normal native volume supported by the specific voice, in the range [-96.0, 16.0]. If unset, or set to a value of 0.0 (dB), will play at normal native signal amplitude. A value of -6.0 (dB) will play at approximately half the amplitude of the normal native signal amplitude. A value of +6.0 (dB) will play at approximately twice the amplitude of the normal native signal amplitude. We strongly recommend not to exceed +10 (dB) as there's usually no effective increase in loudness for any value greater than that. About Cursors The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. . Each additional . moves it up one additional level. E.g. ... would go three levels up.

An identifier which selects 'audio effects' profiles that are applied on (post synthesized) text to speech. Effects are applied on top of each other in the order they are given. Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. pitch=0.3850966597070734 Optional. Speaking pitch, in the range [-20.0, 20.0]. 20 means increase 20 semitones from the original pitch. -20 means decrease 20 semitones from the original pitch. speaking-rate=0.3881186367850509 Optional. Speaking rate/speed, in the range [0.25, 4.0]. 1.0 is the normal native speed supported by the specific voice. 2.0 is twice as fast, and 0.5 is half as fast. If unset(0.0), defaults to the native 1.0 speed. Any other values < 0.25 or > 4.0 will return an error. voice name=labore Optional. The name of the voice. If not set, the service will choose a voice based on the other parameters such as language_code and ssml_gender. For the list of available voices, please refer to Supported voices and languages . ssml-gender=sed Optional. The preferred gender of the voice. If not set, the service will choose a voice based on the other parameters such as language_code and name. Note that this is only a preference, not requirement. If a voice of the appropriate gender is not available, the synthesizer substitutes a voice with a different gender rather than failing the request. .. volume-gain-db=0.7672121825109711 Optional. Volume gain (in dB) of the normal native volume supported by the specific voice, in the range [-96.0, 16.0]. If unset, or set to a value of 0.0 (dB), will play at normal native signal amplitude. A value of -6.0 (dB) will play at approximately half the amplitude of the normal native signal amplitude. A value of +6.0 (dB) will play at approximately twice the amplitude of the normal native signal amplitude.

The human-readable name of the webhook, unique within the agent. generic-web-service allowed-ca-certs=sed Optional. Specifies a list of allowed custom CA certificates (in DER format) for HTTPS verification. This overrides the default SSL trust store. If this is empty or unspecified, Dialogflow will use Google's default trust store to verify certificates. N.B. Make sure the HTTPS server certificates are signed with \"subject alt name\".

About Cursors The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. . Each additional . moves it up one additional level. E.g. ... would go three levels up. Optional Output Flags The method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default. -o out out specifies the destination to which to write the server's result to.

The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. .
