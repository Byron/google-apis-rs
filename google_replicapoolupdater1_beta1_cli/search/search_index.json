By default all output is printed to standard out, but flags can be set to direct it into a file independent of your shell's capabilities. Errors will be printed to standard error, and cause the program's exit code to be non-zero. If data-structures are requested, these will be returned as pretty-printed JSON, to be useful as input to other tools. Everything else about the replicapoolupdater API can be found at the official documentation site . Installation and Source Code Install the command-line interface with cargo using: cargo install google-replicapoolupdater1_beta1-cli Find the source code on github . Usage This documentation was generated from the replicapoolupdater API at revision 20161003 .

Specify the authentication a method should be executed in. Each scope requires the user to grant this application permission to use it. If unset, it defaults to the shortest scope url for a particular method. --config-dir <folder> A directory into which we will store our persistent data. Defaults to a user-writable directory that we will create during the first invocation. [default: ~/.google-service-cli] Configuration The program will store all persistent data in the ~/.google-service-cli directory in JSON files prefixed with replicapoolupdater1-beta1- . You can change the directory used to store configuration with the --config-dir flag on a per-invocation basis. More information about the various kinds of persistent data are given in the following paragraphs. Authentication Most APIs require a user to authenticate any request. If this is the case, the scope determines the set of permissions granted. The granularity of these is usually no more than read-only or full-access . If not set, the system will automatically select the smallest feasible scope, e.g. when invoking a method that is read-only, it will ask only for a read-only scope. You may use the --scope flag to specify a scope directly. All applicable scopes are documented in the respective method's CLI documentation. The first time a scope is used, the user is asked for permission. Follow the instructions given by the CLI to grant permissions, or to decline. If a scope was authenticated by the user, the respective information will be stored as JSON in the configuration directory, e.g. ~/.google-service-cli/replicapoolupdater1-beta1-token-<scope-hash>.json . No manual management of these tokens is necessary. To revoke granted authentication, please refer to the official documentation . Application Secrets In order to allow any application to use Google services, it will need to be registered using the Google Developer Console . APIs the application may use are then enabled for it one by one. Most APIs can be used for free and have a daily quota. To allow more comfortable usage of the CLI without forcing anyone to register an own application, the CLI comes with a default application secret that is configured accordingly. This also means that heavy usage all around the world may deplete the daily quota. You can workaround this limitation by putting your own secrets file at this location: ~/.google-service-cli/replicapoolupdater1-beta1-secret.json , assuming that the required replicapoolupdater API was enabled for it. Such a secret file can be downloaded in the Google Developer Console at APIs & auth -> Credentials -> Download JSON and used as is. Learn more about how to setup Google projects and enable APIs using the official documentation . Debugging Even though the CLI does its best to provide usable error messages, sometimes it might be desirable to know what exactly led to a particular issue. This is done by allowing all client-server communication to be output to standard error as-is . The --debug flag will print errors using the Debug representation to standard error. You may consider redirecting standard error into a file for ease of use, e.g. replicapoolupdater1-beta1 --debug <resource> <method> [options] 2>debug.txt .","title":"Home"},{"location":"#installation-and-source-code","text":"Install the command-line interface with cargo using: cargo install google-replicapoolupdater1_beta1-cli Find the source code on github .","title":"Installation and Source Code"},{"location":"#usage","text":"This documentation was generated from the replicapoolupdater API at revision 20161003 .

Required Request Value The request value is a data-structure with various fields. Each field may be a simple scalar or another data-structure. In the latter case it is advised to set the field-cursor to the data-structure's field to specify values more concisely. For example, a structure like this: RollingUpdate: action-type: string creation-timestamp: string description: string id: string instance-group: string instance-group-manager: string instance-template: string kind: string old-instance-template: string policy: auto-pause-after-instances: integer instance-startup-timeout-sec: integer max-num-concurrent-instances: integer max-num-failed-instances: integer min-instance-update-time-sec: integer progress: integer self-link: string status: string status-message: string user: string can be set completely with the following arguments which are assumed to be executed in the given order. Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time. -r . action-type=et Specifies the action to take for each instance within the instance group. This can be RECREATE which will recreate each instance and is only available for managed instance groups. It can also be REBOOT which performs a soft reboot for each instance and is only available for regular (non-managed) instance groups. creation-timestamp=magna [Output Only] Creation timestamp in RFC3339 text format. description=no An optional textual description of the resource; provided by the client when the resource is created. id=ipsum [Output Only] Unique identifier for the resource; defined by the server. instance-group=voluptua. Fully-qualified URL of an instance group being updated. Exactly one of instanceGroupManager and instanceGroup must be set. instance-group-manager=at Fully-qualified URL of an instance group manager being updated. Exactly one of instanceGroupManager and instanceGroup must be set. instance-template=sanctus Fully-qualified URL of an instance template to apply. kind=sed [Output Only] Type of the resource. old-instance-template=amet. Fully-qualified URL of the instance template encountered while starting the update. policy auto-pause-after-instances=42 Number of instances to update before the updater pauses the rolling update. instance-startup-timeout-sec=49 The maximum amount of time that the updater waits for a HEALTHY state after all of the update steps are complete. If the HEALTHY state is not received before the deadline, the instance update is considered a failure. max-num-concurrent-instances=81 The maximum number of instances that can be updated simultaneously. An instance update is considered complete only after the instance is restarted and initialized. max-num-failed-instances=46 The maximum number of instance updates that can fail before the group update is considered a failure. An instance update is considered failed if any of its update actions (e.g. Stop call on Instance resource in Rolling Reboot) failed with permanent failure, or if the instance is in an UNHEALTHY state after it finishes all of the update actions. min-instance-update-time-sec=39 The minimum amount of time that the updater spends to update each instance. Update time is the time it takes to complete all update actions (e.g. Stop call on Instance resource in Rolling Reboot), reboot, and initialize. If the instance update finishes early, the updater pauses for the remainder of the time before it starts the next instance update. .. progress=50 [Output Only] An optional progress indicator that ranges from 0 to 100.

This number should be monotonically increasing as the update progresses. self-link=gubergren [Output Only] The fully qualified URL for the resource. status=eos [Output Only] Status of the update. Possible values are: \"ROLLING_FORWARD\": The update is going forward. \"ROLLING_BACK\": The update is being rolled back. \"PAUSED\": The update is temporarily paused (inactive). \"ROLLED_OUT\": The update is finished, all instances have been updated successfully. \"ROLLED_BACK\": The update is finished, all instances have been reverted to the previous template. \"CANCELLED\": The update is paused and no longer can be resumed, undefined how many instances are running in which template. status-message=dolor [Output Only] An optional textual description of the current status of the update. user=ea [Output Only] User who requested the update, for example: user@example.com. About Cursors The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. . Each additional . moves it up one additional level. E.g. ... would go three levels up.
