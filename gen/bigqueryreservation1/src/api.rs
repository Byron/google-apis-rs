A `binding` binds one or more `members`, or principals, to a single `role`. Principals can be user accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies). **JSON example:** `{ "bindings": [ { "role": "roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin", "members": [ "user:mike@example.com", "group:admins@example.com", "domain:google.com", "serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com" ] }, { "role": "roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer", "members": [ "user:eve@example.com" ], "condition": { "title": "expirable access", "description": "Does not grant access after Sep 2020", "expression": "request.time < timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z')", } } ], "etag": "BwWWja0YfJA=", "version": 3 }` **YAML example:** `bindings: - members: - user:mike@example.com - group:admins@example.com - domain:google.com - serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin - members: - user:eve@example.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer condition: title: expirable access description: Does not grant access after Sep 2020 expression: request.time < timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z') etag: BwWWja0YfJA= version: 3` For a description of IAM and its features, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/).

NOTE: capping a reservation's idle slot usage is best effort and its usage may exceed the max_slots value. However, in terms of autoscale.current_slots (which accounts for the additional added slots), it will never exceed the max_slots - baseline. This field must be set together with the scaling_mode enum value, otherwise the request will be rejected with error code `google.rpc.Code.INVALID_ARGUMENT`. If the max_slots and scaling_mode are set, the autoscale or autoscale.max_slots field must be unset. Otherwise the request will be rejected with error code `google.rpc.Code.INVALID_ARGUMENT`. However, the autoscale field may still be in the output. The autopscale.max_slots will always show as 0 and the autoscaler.current_slots will represent the current slots from autoscaler excluding idle slots. For example, if the max_slots is 1000 and scaling_mode is AUTOSCALE_ONLY, then in the output, the autoscaler.max_slots will be 0 and the autoscaler.current_slots may be any value between 0 and 1000. If the max_slots is 1000, scaling_mode is ALL_SLOTS, the baseline is 100 and idle slots usage is 200, then in the output, the autoscaler.max_slots will be 0 and the autoscaler.current_slots will not be higher than 700. If the max_slots is 1000, scaling_mode is IDLE_SLOTS_ONLY, then in the output, the autoscaler field will be null. If the max_slots and scaling_mode are set, then the ignore_idle_slots field must be aligned with the scaling_mode enum value.(See details in ScalingMode comments). Otherwise the request will be rejected with error code `google.rpc.Code.INVALID_ARGUMENT`. Please note, the max_slots is for user to manage the part of slots greater than the baseline. Therefore, we don't allow users to set max_slots smaller or equal to the baseline as it will not be meaningful.

Currently a resource (project, folder, organization) can only have one assignment per each (job_type, location) combination, and that reservation will be used for all jobs of the matching type. Different assignments can be created on different levels of the projects, folders or organization hierarchy. During query execution, the assignment is looked up at the project, folder and organization levels in that order. The first assignment found is applied to the query. When creating assignments, it does not matter if other assignments exist at higher levels. Example: * The organization `organizationA` contains two projects, `project1` and `project2`. * Assignments for all three entities (`organizationA`, `project1`, and `project2`) could all be created and mapped to the same or different reservations. "None" assignments represent an absence of the assignment. Projects assigned to None use on-demand pricing. To create a "None" assignment, use "none" as a reservation_id in the parent. Example parent: `projects/myproject/locations/US/reservations/none`. Returns `google.rpc.Code.PERMISSION_DENIED` if user does not have 'bigquery.admin' permissions on the project using the reservation and the project that owns this reservation. Returns `google.rpc.Code.INVALID_ARGUMENT` when location of the assignment does not match location of the reservation.

/// Creates an assignment object which allows the given project to submit jobs of a certain type using slots from the specified reservation. Currently a resource (project, folder, organization) can only have one assignment per each (job_type, location) combination, and that reservation will be used for all jobs of the matching type. Different assignments can be created on different levels of the projects, folders or organization hierarchy. During query execution, the assignment is looked up at the project, folder and organization levels in that order. The first assignment found is applied to the query. When creating assignments, it does not matter if other assignments exist at higher levels. Example: * The organization `organizationA` contains two projects, `project1` and `project2`. * Assignments for all three entities (`organizationA`, `project1`, and `project2`) could all be created and mapped to the same or different reservations. "None" assignments represent an absence of the assignment. Projects assigned to None use on-demand pricing. To create a "None" assignment, use "none" as a reservation_id in the parent. Example parent: `projects/myproject/locations/US/reservations/none`. Returns `google.rpc.Code.PERMISSION_DENIED` if user does not have 'bigquery.admin' permissions on the project using the reservation and the project that owns this reservation. Returns `google.rpc.Code.INVALID_ARGUMENT` when location of the assignment does not match location of the reservation.

Otherwise assignments created on the closest ancestor will be returned. 3. Assignments for different JobTypes will all be returned. The same logic applies if the request is about a folder. If the request is about an organization, then assignments created on the organization will be returned (organization doesn't have ancestors). Comparing to ListAssignments, there are some behavior differences: 1. permission on the assignee will be verified in this API. 2. Hierarchy lookup (project->folder->organization) happens in this API. 3. Parent here is `projects/*/locations/*`, instead of `projects/*/locations/*reservations/*`. **Note** "-" cannot be used for projects nor locations.
