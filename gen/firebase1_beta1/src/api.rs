    /// Adds Firebase resources to the specified existing [Google Cloud Platform (GCP) `Project`] (https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/reference/rest/v1/projects). Since a FirebaseProject is actually also a GCP `Project`, a `FirebaseProject` has the same underlying GCP identifiers (`projectNumber` and `projectId`). This allows for easy interop with Google APIs. The result of this call is an [`Operation`](../../v1beta1/operations). Poll the `Operation` to track the provisioning process by calling GetOperation until [`done`](../../v1beta1/operations#Operation.FIELDS.done) is `true`. When `done` is `true`, the `Operation` has either succeeded or failed. If the `Operation` succeeded, its [`response`](../../v1beta1/operations#Operation.FIELDS.response) is set to a FirebaseProject; if the `Operation` failed, its [`error`](../../v1beta1/operations#Operation.FIELDS.error) is set to a google.rpc.Status. The `Operation` is automatically deleted after completion, so there is no need to call DeleteOperation. This method does not modify any billing account information on the underlying GCP `Project`. To call `AddFirebase`, a project member or service account must have the following permissions (the IAM roles of Editor and Owner contain these permissions): `firebase.projects.update`, `resourcemanager.projects.get`, `serviceusage.services.enable`, and `serviceusage.services.get`.
    ///

After calling `AddFirebase`, the unique Project identifiers ( [`projectNumber`](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/reference/rest/v1/projects#Project.FIELDS.project_number) and [`projectId`](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/reference/rest/v1/projects#Project.FIELDS.project_id)) of the underlying GCP `Project` are also the identifiers of the FirebaseProject.

Using this call, you can either: - Specify an `analyticsAccountId` to provision a new Google Analytics property within the specified account and associate the new property with the `FirebaseProject`. - Specify an existing `analyticsPropertyId` to associate the property with the `FirebaseProject`. Note that when you call `AddGoogleAnalytics`: 1. The first check determines if any existing data streams in the Google Analytics property correspond to any existing Firebase Apps in the `FirebaseProject` (based on the `packageName` or `bundleId` associated with the data stream). Then, as applicable, the data streams and apps are linked. Note that this auto-linking only applies to `AndroidApps` and `IosApps`. 2. If no corresponding data streams are found for the Firebase Apps, new data streams are provisioned in the Google Analytics property for each of the Firebase Apps. Note that a new data stream is always provisioned for a Web App even if it was previously associated with a data stream in the Analytics property. Learn more about the hierarchy and structure of Google Analytics accounts in the [Analytics documentation](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/9303323). The result of this call is an [`Operation`](../../v1beta1/operations). Poll the `Operation` to track the provisioning process by calling GetOperation until [`done`](../../v1beta1/operations#Operation.FIELDS.done) is `true`. When `done` is `true`, the `Operation` has either succeeded or failed. If the `Operation` succeeded, its [`response`](../../v1beta1/operations#Operation.FIELDS.response) is set to an AnalyticsDetails; if the `Operation` failed, its [`error`](../../v1beta1/operations#Operation.FIELDS.error) is set to a google.rpc.Status. To call `AddGoogleAnalytics`, a project member must be an Owner for the existing `FirebaseProject` and have the [`Edit` permission](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2884495) for the Google Analytics account. If the `FirebaseProject` already has Google Analytics enabled, and you call `AddGoogleAnalytics` using an `analyticsPropertyId` that's different from the currently associated property, then the call will fail. Analytics may have already been enabled in the Firebase console or by specifying `timeZone` and `regionCode` in the call to [`AddFirebase`](../../v1beta1/projects/addFirebase).

/// Sets the default Google Cloud Platform (GCP) resource location for the specified FirebaseProject. This method creates an App Engine application with a [default Cloud Storage bucket](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/googlecloudstorageclient/setting-up-cloud-storage#activating_a_cloud_storage_bucket), located in the specified [`locationId`](#body.request_body.FIELDS.location_id). This location must be one of the available [GCP resource locations](https://firebase.google.com/docs/projects/locations). After the default GCP resource location is finalized, or if it was already set, it cannot be changed. The default GCP resource location for the specified `FirebaseProject` might already be set because either the underlying GCP `Project` already has an App Engine application or `FinalizeDefaultLocation` was previously called with a specified `locationId`. Any new calls to `FinalizeDefaultLocation` with a *different* specified `locationId` will return a 409 error. The result of this call is an [`Operation`](../../v1beta1/operations), which can be used to track the provisioning process. The [`response`](../../v1beta1/operations#Operation.FIELDS.response) type of the `Operation` is google.protobuf.Empty. The `Operation` can be polled by its `name` using GetOperation until `done` is true. When `done` is true, the `Operation` has either succeeded or failed. If the `Operation` has succeeded, its [`response`](../../v1beta1/operations#Operation.FIELDS.response) will be set to a google.protobuf.Empty; if the `Operation` has failed, its `error` will be set to a google.rpc.Status. The `Operation` is automatically deleted after completion, so there is no need to call DeleteOperation. All fields listed in the [request body](#request-body) are required. To call `FinalizeDefaultLocation`, a member must be an Owner of the Project.

/// Adds Firebase resources to the specified existing [Google Cloud Platform (GCP) `Project`] (https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/reference/rest/v1/projects). Since a FirebaseProject is actually also a GCP `Project`, a `FirebaseProject` has the same underlying GCP identifiers (`projectNumber` and `projectId`). This allows for easy interop with Google APIs. The result of this call is an [`Operation`](../../v1beta1/operations). Poll the `Operation` to track the provisioning process by calling GetOperation until [`done`](../../v1beta1/operations#Operation.FIELDS.done) is `true`. When `done` is `true`, the `Operation` has either succeeded or failed. If the `Operation` succeeded, its [`response`](../../v1beta1/operations#Operation.FIELDS.response) is set to a FirebaseProject; if the `Operation` failed, its [`error`](../../v1beta1/operations#Operation.FIELDS.error) is set to a google.rpc.Status. The `Operation` is automatically deleted after completion, so there is no need to call DeleteOperation. This method does not modify any billing account information on the underlying GCP `Project`. To call `AddFirebase`, a project member or service account must have the following permissions (the IAM roles of Editor and Owner contain these permissions): `firebase.projects.update`, `resourcemanager.projects.get`, `serviceusage.services.enable`, and `serviceusage.services.get`.

/// Links the specified FirebaseProject with an existing [Google Analytics account](http://www.google.com/analytics/). Using this call, you can either: - Specify an `analyticsAccountId` to provision a new Google Analytics property within the specified account and associate the new property with the `FirebaseProject`. - Specify an existing `analyticsPropertyId` to associate the property with the `FirebaseProject`. Note that when you call `AddGoogleAnalytics`: 1. The first check determines if any existing data streams in the Google Analytics property correspond to any existing Firebase Apps in the `FirebaseProject` (based on the `packageName` or `bundleId` associated with the data stream). Then, as applicable, the data streams and apps are linked. Note that this auto-linking only applies to `AndroidApps` and `IosApps`. 2. If no corresponding data streams are found for the Firebase Apps, new data streams are provisioned in the Google Analytics property for each of the Firebase Apps. Note that a new data stream is always provisioned for a Web App even if it was previously associated with a data stream in the Analytics property. Learn more about the hierarchy and structure of Google Analytics accounts in the [Analytics documentation](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/9303323). The result of this call is an [`Operation`](../../v1beta1/operations). Poll the `Operation` to track the provisioning process by calling GetOperation until [`done`](../../v1beta1/operations#Operation.FIELDS.done) is `true`. When `done` is `true`, the `Operation` has either succeeded or failed. If the `Operation` succeeded, its [`response`](../../v1beta1/operations#Operation.FIELDS.response) is set to an AnalyticsDetails; if the `Operation` failed, its [`error`](../../v1beta1/operations#Operation.FIELDS.error) is set to a google.rpc.Status. To call `AddGoogleAnalytics`, a project member must be an Owner for the existing `FirebaseProject` and have the [`Edit` permission](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2884495) for the Google Analytics account. If the `FirebaseProject` already has Google Analytics enabled, and you call `AddGoogleAnalytics` using an `analyticsPropertyId` that's different from the currently associated property, then the call will fail. Analytics may have already been enabled in the Firebase console or by specifying `timeZone` and `regionCode` in the call to [`AddFirebase`](../../v1beta1/projects/addFirebase).
