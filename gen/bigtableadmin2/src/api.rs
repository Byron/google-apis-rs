/// Lists operations that match the specified filter in the request. If the server doesn't support this method, it returns `UNIMPLEMENTED`. NOTE: the `name` binding allows API services to override the binding to use different resource name schemes, such as `users/*/operations`. To override the binding, API services can add a binding such as `"/v1/{name=users/*}/operations"` to their service configuration. For backwards compatibility, the default name includes the operations collection id, however overriding users must ensure the name binding is the parent resource, without the operations collection id.

If the server doesn't support this method, it returns `google.rpc.Code.UNIMPLEMENTED`. Clients can use Operations.GetOperation or other methods to check whether the cancellation succeeded or whether the operation completed despite cancellation. On successful cancellation, the operation is not deleted; instead, it becomes an operation with an Operation.error value with a google.rpc.Status.code of 1, corresponding to `Code.CANCELLED`.

The default sorting order is ascending. To specify descending order for the field, a suffix " desc" should be appended to the field name. For example, "start_time desc".

Filter rules are case insensitive.

By default, each expression is an AND expression. However, you can include AND, OR, and NOT expressions explicitly. Some examples of using filters are: * `name:"exact"` --> The backup's name is the string "exact". * `name:howl` --> The backup's name contains the string "howl". * `source_table:prod` --> The source_table's name contains the string "prod". * `state:CREATING` --> The backup is pending creation. * `state:READY` --> The backup is fully created and ready for use. * `(name:howl) AND (start_time < \"2018-03-28T14:50:00Z\")` --> The backup name contains the string "howl" and start_time of the backup is before 2018-03-28T14:50:00Z. * `size_bytes > 10000000000` --> The backup's size is greater than 10GB
