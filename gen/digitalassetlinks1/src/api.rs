/// Retrieves a list of all statements from a given source that match the specified target and statement string. The API guarantees that all statements with secure source assets, such as HTTPS websites or Android apps, have been made in a secure way by the owner of those assets, as described in the [Digital Asset Links technical design specification](https://github.com/google/digitalassetlinks/blob/master/well-known/details.md). Specifically, you should consider that for insecure websites (that is, where the URL starts with `http://` instead of `https://`), this guarantee cannot be made. The `List` command is most useful in cases where the API client wants to know all the ways in which two assets are related, or enumerate all the relationships from a particular source asset. Example: a feature that helps users navigate to related items. When a mobile app is running on a device, the feature would make it easy to navigate to the corresponding web site or Google+ profile.

    /// Web assets are identified by a URL that contains only the scheme, hostname and port parts. The format is http[s]://[:] Hostnames must be fully qualified: they must end in a single period ("`.`"). Only the schemes "http" and "https" are currently allowed. Port numbers are given as a decimal number, and they must be omitted if the standard port numbers are used: 80 for http and 443 for https. We call this limited URL the "site". All URLs that share the same scheme, hostname and port are considered to be a part of the site and thus belong to the web asset. Example: the asset with the site `https://www.google.com` contains all these URLs: * `https://www.google.com/` * `https://www.google.com:443/` * `https://www.google.com/foo` * `https://www.google.com/foo?bar` * `https://www.google.com/foo#bar` * `https://user@password:www.google.com/` But it does not contain these URLs: * `http://www.google.com/` (wrong scheme) * `https://google.com/` (hostname does not match) * `https://www.google.com:444/` (port does not match) REQUIRED
