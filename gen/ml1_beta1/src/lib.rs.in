/// The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for different
/// programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is used by
/// [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). The error model is designed to be:
/// 
/// - Simple to use and understand for most users
/// - Flexible enough to meet unexpected needs
/// 
/// # Overview
/// 
/// The `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message,
/// and error details. The error code should be an enum value of
/// google.rpc.Code, but it may accept additional error codes if needed.  The
/// error message should be a developer-facing English message that helps
/// developers *understand* and *resolve* the error. If a localized user-facing
/// error message is needed, put the localized message in the error details or
/// localize it in the client. The optional error details may contain arbitrary
/// information about the error. There is a predefined set of error detail types
/// in the package `google.rpc` which can be used for common error conditions.
/// 
/// # Language mapping
/// 
/// The `Status` message is the logical representation of the error model, but it
/// is not necessarily the actual wire format. When the `Status` message is
/// exposed in different client libraries and different wire protocols, it can be
/// mapped differently. For example, it will likely be mapped to some exceptions
/// in Java, but more likely mapped to some error codes in C.
/// 
/// # Other uses
/// 
/// The error model and the `Status` message can be used in a variety of
/// environments, either with or without APIs, to provide a
/// consistent developer experience across different environments.
/// 
/// Example uses of this error model include:
/// 
/// - Partial errors. If a service needs to return partial errors to the client,
///     it may embed the `Status` in the normal response to indicate the partial
///     errors.
/// 
/// - Workflow errors. A typical workflow has multiple steps. Each step may
///     have a `Status` message for error reporting purpose.
/// 
/// - Batch operations. If a client uses batch request and batch response, the
///     `Status` message should be used directly inside batch response, one for
///     each error sub-response.
/// 
/// - Asynchronous operations. If an API call embeds asynchronous operation
///     results in its response, the status of those operations should be
///     represented directly using the `Status` message.
/// 
/// - Logging. If some API errors are stored in logs, the message `Status` could
///     be used directly after any stripping needed for security/privacy reasons.
/// 
/// This type is not used in any activity, and only used as *part* of another schema.
///
