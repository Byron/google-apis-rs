Groups can contain any number of monitored resources, and each monitored resource can be a member of any number of groups. Groups can be nested in parent-child hierarchies. The `parentName` field identifies an optional parent for each group. If a group has a parent, then the only monitored resources available to be matched by the group's filter are the resources contained in the parent group. In other words, a group contains the monitored resources that match its filter and the filters of all the group's ancestors. A group without a parent can contain any monitored resource. For example, consider an infrastructure running a set of instances with two user-defined tags: `"environment"` and `"role"`. A parent group has a filter, `environment="production"`. A child of that parent group has a filter, `role="transcoder"`. The parent group contains all instances in the production environment, regardless of their roles. The child group contains instances that have the transcoder role *and* are in the production environment. The monitored resources contained in a group can change at any moment, depending on what resources exist and what filters are associated with the group and its ancestors.

The grammar also includes these connectors: * `/` division (as an infix operator, e.g. `1/s`). * `.` multiplication (as an infix operator, e.g. `GBy.d`) The grammar for a unit is as follows: Expression = Component { "." Component } { "/" Component } ; Component = [ PREFIX ] UNIT [ Annotation ] | Annotation | "1" ; Annotation = "{" NAME "}" ; Notes: * `Annotation` is just a comment if it follows a `UNIT` and is equivalent to `1` if it is used alone. For examples, `{requests}/s == 1/s`, `By{transmitted}/s == By/s`. * `NAME` is a sequence of non-blank printable ASCII characters not containing '{' or '}'.

/// A Distribution may optionally contain a histogram of the values in the population. The histogram is given in `bucket_counts` as counts of values that fall into one of a sequence of non-overlapping buckets. The sequence of buckets is described by `bucket_options`. A bucket specifies an inclusive lower bound and exclusive upper bound for the values that are counted for that bucket. The upper bound of a bucket is strictly greater than the lower bound. The sequence of N buckets for a Distribution consists of an underflow bucket (number 0), zero or more finite buckets (number 1 through N - 2) and an overflow bucket (number N - 1). The buckets are contiguous: the lower bound of bucket i (i > 0) is the same as the upper bound of bucket i - 1. The buckets span the whole range of finite values: lower bound of the underflow bucket is -infinity and the upper bound of the overflow bucket is +infinity. The finite buckets are so-called because both bounds are finite. `BucketOptions` describes bucket boundaries in one of three ways. Two describe the boundaries by giving parameters for a formula to generate boundaries and one gives the bucket boundaries explicitly. If `bucket_boundaries` is not given, then no `bucket_counts` may be given.
