A `binding` binds one or more `members`, or principals, to a single `role`. Principals can be user accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies). **JSON example:** { “bindings”: \[ { “role”: “roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin”, “members”: \[ “user:mike@example.com”, “group:admins@example.com”, “domain:google.com”, “serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com” \] }, { “role”: “roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer”, “members”: \[ “user:eve@example.com” \], “condition”: { “title”: “expirable access”, “description”: “Does not grant access after Sep 2020”, “expression”: “request.time \< timestamp(‘2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z’)”, } } \], “etag”: “BwWWja0YfJA=”, “version”: 3 } **YAML example:** bindings: - members: - user:mike@example.com - group:admins@example.com - domain:google.com - serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin - members: - user:eve@example.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer condition: title: expirable access description: Does not grant access after Sep 2020 expression: request.time \< timestamp(‘2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z’) etag: BwWWja0YfJA= version: 3 For a description of IAM and its features, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/).
