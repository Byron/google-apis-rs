Field paths may be used in other contexts to refer to structured fields defined here. For `map_value`, the field path is represented by a dot-delimited (`.`) string of segments. Each segment is either a simple field name (defined below) or a quoted field name. For example, the structured field `"foo" : { map_value: { "x&y" : { string_value: "hello" }}}` would be represented by the field path `` foo.`x&y` ``. A simple field name contains only characters `a` to `z`, `A` to `Z`, `0` to `9`, or `_`, and must not start with `0` to `9`. For example, `foo_bar_17`. A quoted field name starts and ends with `` ` `` and may contain any character. Some characters, including `` ` ``, must be escaped using a `\`. For example, `` `x&y` `` represents `x&y` and `` `bak\`tik` `` represents `` bak`tik ``.

Continuing off the example above, attaching the following start cursors will have varying impact: - `START BEFORE (2, /k/123)`: start the query right before `a = 1 AND b > 2 AND __name__ > /k/123`. - `START AFTER (10)`: start the query right after `a = 1 AND b > 10`.

The only valid special field is `*`, which represents any field. Field paths can be quoted using `` ` `` (backtick). The only character that must be escaped within a quoted field path is the backtick character itself, escaped using a backslash. Special characters in field paths that must be quoted include: `*`, `.`, `` ` `` (backtick), `[`, `]`, as well as any ascii symbolic characters. Examples: `` `address.city` `` represents a field named `address.city`, not the map key `city` in the field `address`. `` `*` `` represents a field named `*`, not any field. A special `Field` contains the default indexing settings for all fields. This field's resource name is: `projects/{project_id}/databases/{database_id}/collectionGroups/__default__/fields/*` Indexes defined on this `Field` will be applied to all fields which do not have their own `Field` index configuration.

This field's resource name is: `projects/{project_id}/databases/{database_id}/collectionGroups/__default__/fields/*` Indexes defined on this `Field` will be applied to all fields which do not have their own `Field` index configuration.
