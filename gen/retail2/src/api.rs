This message can be used both in streaming and non-streaming API methods in the request as well as the response. It can be used as a top-level request field, which is convenient if one wants to extract parameters from either the URL or HTTP template into the request fields and also want access to the raw HTTP body. Example: message GetResourceRequest { // A unique request id. string request_id = 1; // The raw HTTP body is bound to this field. google.api.HttpBody http_body = 2; } service ResourceService { rpc GetResource(GetResourceRequest) returns (google.api.HttpBody); rpc UpdateResource(google.api.HttpBody) returns (google.protobuf.Empty); } Example with streaming methods: service CaldavService { rpc GetCalendar(stream google.api.HttpBody) returns (stream google.api.HttpBody); rpc UpdateCalendar(stream google.api.HttpBody) returns (stream google.api.HttpBody); } Use of this type only changes how the request and response bodies are handled, all other features will continue to work unchanged.

For example, you may always want to have rating facet returned in the response, but it's not necessarily to always display the rating facet at the top. In that case, you can set enable_dynamic_position to true so that the position of rating facet in response will be determined by Google Retail Search. Another example, assuming you have the following facets in the request: * "rating", enable_dynamic_position = true * "price", enable_dynamic_position = false * "brands", enable_dynamic_position = false And also you have a dynamic facets enable, which will generate a facet 'gender'. Then the final order of the facets in the response can be ("price", "brands", "rating", "gender") or ("price", "brands", "gender", "rating") depends on how Google Retail Search orders "gender" and "rating" facets. However, notice that "price" and "brands" will always be ranked at 1st and 2nd position since their enable_dynamic_position are false.

A query containing the filter "colorFamilies:ANY("Red")" and have "colorFamilies" as FacetKey.key will by default return the "Red" with count 100. If this field contains "colorFamilies", then the query returns both the "Red" with count 100 and "Blue" with count 200, because the "colorFamilies" key is now excluded from the filter.

For example, if `projects/*/locations/*/catalogs/*/branches/1` is set as default, setting SearchRequest.branch to `projects/*/locations/*/catalogs/*/branches/default_branch` is equivalent to setting SearchRequest.branch to `projects/*/locations/*/catalogs/*/branches/1`. Using multiple branches can be useful when developers would like to have a staging branch to test and verify for future usage. When it becomes ready, developers switch on the staging branch using this API while keeping using `projects/*/locations/*/catalogs/*/branches/default_branch` as SearchRequest.branch to route the traffic to this staging branch. CAUTION: If you have live predict/search traffic, switching the default branch could potentially cause outages if the ID space of the new branch is very different from the old one. More specifically: * PredictionService will only return product IDs from branch {newBranch}. * SearchService will only return product IDs from branch {newBranch} (if branch is not explicitly set). * UserEventService will only join events with products from branch {newBranch}.

/// Updates inventory information for a Product while respecting the last update timestamps of each inventory field. This process is asynchronous and does not require the Product to exist before updating fulfillment information. If the request is valid, the update will be enqueued and processed downstream. As a consequence, when a response is returned, updates are not immediately manifested in the Product queried by GetProduct or ListProducts. When inventory is updated with CreateProduct and UpdateProduct, the specified inventory field value(s) will overwrite any existing value(s) while ignoring the last update time for this field. Furthermore, the last update time for the specified inventory fields will be overwritten to the time of the CreateProduct or UpdateProduct request. If no inventory fields are set in CreateProductRequest.product, then any pre-existing inventory information for this product will be used. If no inventory fields are set in SetInventoryRequest.set_mask, then any existing inventory information will be preserved. Pre-existing inventory information can only be updated with SetInventory, AddFulfillmentPlaces, and RemoveFulfillmentPlaces. This feature is only available for users who have Retail Search enabled. Please submit a form [here](https://cloud.google.com/contact) to contact cloud sales if you are interested in using Retail Search.

/// Set a specified branch id as default branch. API methods such as SearchService.Search, ProductService.GetProduct, ProductService.ListProducts will treat requests using "default_branch" to the actual branch id set as default. For example, if `projects/*/locations/*/catalogs/*/branches/1` is set as default, setting SearchRequest.branch to `projects/*/locations/*/catalogs/*/branches/default_branch` is equivalent to setting SearchRequest.branch to `projects/*/locations/*/catalogs/*/branches/1`. Using multiple branches can be useful when developers would like to have a staging branch to test and verify for future usage. When it becomes ready, developers switch on the staging branch using this API while keeping using `projects/*/locations/*/catalogs/*/branches/default_branch` as SearchRequest.branch to route the traffic to this staging branch. CAUTION: If you have live predict/search traffic, switching the default branch could potentially cause outages if the ID space of the new branch is very different from the old one. More specifically: * PredictionService will only return product IDs from branch {newBranch}. * SearchService will only return product IDs from branch {newBranch} (if branch is not explicitly set). * UserEventService will only join events with products from branch {newBranch}.

To override the binding, API services can add a binding such as `"/v1/{name=users/*}/operations"` to their service configuration.
