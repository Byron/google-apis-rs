Routes match packets by destination IP address, preferring smaller or more specific ranges over larger ones. If there is a tie, the system selects the Route with the smallest priority value.

The packet is then forwarded as specified by the nextHop field of the winning Route -- either to another instance destination, a instance gateway or a Google Compute Engien-operated gateway.
