By default all output is printed to standard out, but flags can be set to direct it into a file independent of your shell's capabilities. Errors will be printed to standard error, and cause the program's exit code to be non-zero. If data-structures are requested, these will be returned as pretty-printed JSON, to be useful as input to other tools. Everything else about the Iam API can be found at the official documentation site . Installation and Source Code Install the command-line interface with cargo using: cargo install google-iam1-cli Find the source code on github .

Specify the authentication a method should be executed in. Each scope requires the user to grant this application permission to use it. If unset, it defaults to the shortest scope url for a particular method. --config-dir <folder> A directory into which we will store our persistent data. Defaults to a user-writable directory that we will create during the first invocation. [default: ~/.google-service-cli] Configuration The program will store all persistent data in the ~/.google-service-cli directory in JSON files prefixed with iam1- . You can change the directory used to store configuration with the --config-dir flag on a per-invocation basis. More information about the various kinds of persistent data are given in the following paragraphs. Authentication Most APIs require a user to authenticate any request. If this is the case, the scope determines the set of permissions granted. The granularity of these is usually no more than read-only or full-access . If not set, the system will automatically select the smallest feasible scope, e.g. when invoking a method that is read-only, it will ask only for a read-only scope. You may use the --scope flag to specify a scope directly. All applicable scopes are documented in the respective method's CLI documentation. The first time a scope is used, the user is asked for permission. Follow the instructions given by the CLI to grant permissions, or to decline. If a scope was authenticated by the user, the respective information will be stored as JSON in the configuration directory, e.g. ~/.google-service-cli/iam1-token-<scope-hash>.json . No manual management of these tokens is necessary. To revoke granted authentication, please refer to the official documentation . Application Secrets In order to allow any application to use Google services, it will need to be registered using the Google Developer Console . APIs the application may use are then enabled for it one by one. Most APIs can be used for free and have a daily quota. To allow more comfortable usage of the CLI without forcing anyone to register an own application, the CLI comes with a default application secret that is configured accordingly. This also means that heavy usage all around the world may deplete the daily quota. You can workaround this limitation by putting your own secrets file at this location: ~/.google-service-cli/iam1-secret.json , assuming that the required iam API was enabled for it. Such a secret file can be downloaded in the Google Developer Console at APIs & auth -> Credentials -> Download JSON and used as is. Learn more about how to setup Google projects and enable APIs using the official documentation . Debugging Even though the CLI does its best to provide usable error messages, sometimes it might be desirable to know what exactly led to a particular issue. This is done by allowing all client-server communication to be output to standard error as-is . The --debug flag will print errors using the Debug representation to standard error. You may consider redirecting standard error into a file for ease of use, e.g. iam1 --debug <resource> <method> [options] 2>debug.txt .","title":"Home"},{"location":"#installation-and-source-code","text":"Install the command-line interface with cargo using: cargo install google-iam1-cli Find the source code on github .","title":"Installation and Source Code"},{"location":"#usage","text":"This documentation was generated from the Iam API at revision 20240220 .

Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time. -r . attribute-condition=est A Common Expression Language expression, in plain text, to restrict what otherwise valid authentication credentials issued by the provider should not be accepted. The expression must output a boolean representing whether to allow the federation. The following keywords may be referenced in the expressions: * assertion : JSON representing the authentication credential issued by the provider. * google : The Google attributes mapped from the assertion in the attribute_mappings . google.profile_photo , google.display_name and google.posix_username are not supported. * attribute : The custom attributes mapped from the assertion in the attribute_mappings . The maximum length of the attribute condition expression is 4096 characters. If unspecified, all valid authentication credentials will be accepted. The following example shows how to only allow credentials with a mapped google.groups value of admins : &#34;&#39;admins&#39; in google.groups&#34; attribute-mapping=key=ipsum Required. Maps attributes from the authentication credentials issued by an external identity provider to Google Cloud attributes, such as subject and segment . Each key must be a string specifying the Google Cloud IAM attribute to map to. The following keys are supported: * google.subject : The principal IAM is authenticating. You can reference this value in IAM bindings. This is also the subject that appears in Cloud Logging logs. This is a required field and the mapped subject cannot exceed 127 bytes. * google.groups : Groups the authenticating user belongs to. You can grant groups access to resources using an IAM principalSet binding; access applies to all members of the group. * google.display_name : The name of the authenticated user. This is an optional field and the mapped display name cannot exceed 100 bytes. If not set, google.subject will be displayed instead. This attribute cannot be referenced in IAM bindings. * google.profile_photo : The URL that specifies the authenticated user's thumbnail photo. This is an optional field. When set, the image will be visible as the user's profile picture. If not set, a generic user icon will be displayed instead. This attribute cannot be referenced in IAM bindings. * google.posix_username : The linux username used by OS login. This is an optional field and the mapped posix username cannot exceed 32 characters, The key must match the regex \"^a-zA-Z0-9. {0,31}$\". This attribute cannot be referenced in IAM bindings. You can also provide custom attributes by specifying attribute.{custom_attribute} , where {custom_attribute} is the name of the custom attribute to be mapped. You can define a maximum of 50 custom attributes. The maximum length of a mapped attribute key is 100 characters, and the key may only contain the characters [a-z0-9 ]. You can reference these attributes in IAM policies to define fine-grained access for a workforce pool to Google Cloud resources. For example: * google.subject : principal://iam.googleapis.com/locations/global/workforcePools/{pool}/subject/{value} * google.groups : principalSet://iam.googleapis.com/locations/global/workforcePools/{pool}/group/{value} * attribute.{custom_attribute} : principalSet://iam.googleapis.com/locations/global/workforcePools/{pool}/attribute.{custom_attribute}/{value} Each value must be a [Common Expression Language] (https://opensource.google/projects/cel) function that maps an identity provider credential to the normalized attribute specified by the corresponding map key. You can use the assertion keyword in the expression to access a JSON representation of the authentication credential issued by the provider. The maximum length of an attribute mapping expression is 2048 characters. When evaluated, the total size of all mapped attributes must not exceed 4KB. For OIDC providers, you must supply a custom mapping that includes the google.subject attribute. For example, the following maps the sub claim of the incoming credential to the subject attribute on a Google token: {&#34;google.subject&#34;: &#34;assertion.sub&#34;} the value will be associated with the given key description=ipsum A user-specified description of the provider. Cannot exceed 256 characters. disabled=true Disables the workforce pool provider. You cannot use a disabled provider to exchange tokens. However, existing tokens still grant access. display-name=ea A user-specified display name for the provider. Cannot exceed 32 characters. expire-time=dolor Output only. Time after which the workload pool provider will be permanently purged and cannot be recovered. name=lorem Output only. The resource name of the provider. Format: locations/{location}/workforcePools/{workforce_pool_id}/providers/{provider_id} oidc client-id=eos Required. The client ID. Must match the audience claim of the JWT issued by the identity provider. client-secret.value plain-text=labore Input only. The plain text of the client secret value. For security reasons, this field is only used for input and will never be populated in any response. thumbprint=sed Output only. A thumbprint to represent the current client secret value. ... issuer-uri=duo Required. The OIDC issuer URI. Must be a valid URI using the 'https' scheme. jwks-json=sed OIDC JWKs in JSON String format. For details on the definition of a JWK, see https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7517. If not set, the jwks_uri from the discovery document(fetched from the .well-known path of the issuer_uri ) will be used. Currently, RSA and EC asymmetric keys are supported. The JWK must use following format and include only the following fields: { \"keys\": [ { \"kty\": \"RSA/EC\", \"alg\": \"\", \"use\": \"sig\", \"kid\": \"\", \"n\": \"\", \"e\": \"\", \"x\": \"\", \"y\": \"\", \"crv\": \"\" } ] } web-sso-config additional-scopes=no Additional scopes to request for in the OIDC authentication request on top of scopes requested by default. By default, the openid , profile and email scopes that are supported by the identity provider are requested. Each additional scope may be at most 256 characters. A maximum of 10 additional scopes may be configured. Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. assertion-claims-behavior=stet Required. The behavior for how OIDC Claims are included in the assertion object used for attribute mapping and attribute condition. response-type=kasd Required. The Response Type to request for in the OIDC Authorization Request for web sign-in. The CODE Response Type is recommended to avoid the Implicit Flow, for security reasons. ...saml idp-metadata-xml=et Required. SAML Identity provider configuration metadata xml doc. The xml document should comply with SAML 2.0 specification . The max size of the acceptable xml document will be bounded to 128k characters. The metadata xml document should satisfy the following constraints: 1) Must contain an Identity Provider Entity ID. 2) Must contain at least one non-expired signing key certificate. 3) For each signing key: a) Valid from should be no more than 7 days from now. b) Valid to should be no more than 15 years in the future. 4) Up to 3 IdP signing keys are allowed in the metadata xml. When updating the provider's metadata xml, at least one non-expired signing key must overlap with the existing metadata. This requirement is skipped if there are no non-expired signing keys present in the existing metadata. .. state=sed Output only. The state of the provider.

The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. . Each additional . moves it up one additional level. E.g. ... would go three levels up. Optional Output Flags The method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default. -o out out specifies the destination to which to write the server's result to. It will be a JSON-encoded structure. The destination may be - to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes. If unset, it defaults to standard output.

Each field may be a simple scalar or another data-structure. In the latter case it is advised to set the field-cursor to the data-structure's field to specify values more concisely. For example, a structure like this: WorkforcePoolProvider: attribute-condition: string attribute-mapping: { string: string } description: string disabled: boolean display-name: string expire-time: string name: string oidc: client-id: string client-secret: value: plain-text: string thumbprint: string issuer-uri: string jwks-json: string web-sso-config: additional-scopes: [string] assertion-claims-behavior: string response-type: string saml: idp-metadata-xml: string state: string can be set completely with the following arguments which are assumed to be executed in the given order. Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time. -r . attribute-condition=est A Common Expression Language expression, in plain text, to restrict what otherwise valid authentication credentials issued by the provider should not be accepted. The expression must output a boolean representing whether to allow the federation. The following keywords may be referenced in the expressions: * assertion : JSON representing the authentication credential issued by the provider. * google : The Google attributes mapped from the assertion in the attribute_mappings . google.profile_photo , google.display_name and google.posix_username are not supported. * attribute : The custom attributes mapped from the assertion in the attribute_mappings . The maximum length of the attribute condition expression is 4096 characters. If unspecified, all valid authentication credentials will be accepted. The following example shows how to only allow credentials with a mapped google.groups value of admins : &#34;&#39;admins&#39; in google.groups&#34; attribute-mapping=key=ipsum Required. Maps attributes from the authentication credentials issued by an external identity provider to Google Cloud attributes, such as subject and segment . Each key must be a string specifying the Google Cloud IAM attribute to map to. The following keys are supported: * google.subject : The principal IAM is authenticating. You can reference this value in IAM bindings. This is also the subject that appears in Cloud Logging logs. This is a required field and the mapped subject cannot exceed 127 bytes. * google.groups : Groups the authenticating user belongs to. You can grant groups access to resources using an IAM principalSet binding; access applies to all members of the group. * google.display_name : The name of the authenticated user. This is an optional field and the mapped display name cannot exceed 100 bytes. If not set, google.subject will be displayed instead. This attribute cannot be referenced in IAM bindings. * google.profile_photo : The URL that specifies the authenticated user's thumbnail photo. This is an optional field. When set, the image will be visible as the user's profile picture. If not set, a generic user icon will be displayed instead. This attribute cannot be referenced in IAM bindings. * google.posix_username : The linux username used by OS login. This is an optional field and the mapped posix username cannot exceed 32 characters, The key must match the regex \"^a-zA-Z0-9. {0,31}$\". This attribute cannot be referenced in IAM bindings. You can also provide custom attributes by specifying attribute.{custom_attribute} , where {custom_attribute} is the name of the custom attribute to be mapped. You can define a maximum of 50 custom attributes. The maximum length of a mapped attribute key is 100 characters, and the key may only contain the characters [a-z0-9 ]. You can reference these attributes in IAM policies to define fine-grained access for a workforce pool to Google Cloud resources. For example: * google.subject : principal://iam.googleapis.com/locations/global/workforcePools/{pool}/subject/{value} * google.groups : principalSet://iam.googleapis.com/locations/global/workforcePools/{pool}/group/{value} * attribute.{custom_attribute} : principalSet://iam.googleapis.com/locations/global/workforcePools/{pool}/attribute.{custom_attribute}/{value} Each value must be a [Common Expression Language] (https://opensource.google/projects/cel) function that maps an identity provider credential to the normalized attribute specified by the corresponding map key. You can use the assertion keyword in the expression to access a JSON representation of the authentication credential issued by the provider. The maximum length of an attribute mapping expression is 2048 characters. When evaluated, the total size of all mapped attributes must not exceed 4KB. For OIDC providers, you must supply a custom mapping that includes the google.subject attribute. For example, the following maps the sub claim of the incoming credential to the subject attribute on a Google token: {&#34;google.subject&#34;: &#34;assertion.sub&#34;} the value will be associated with the given key description=ipsum A user-specified description of the provider. Cannot exceed 256 characters. disabled=true Disables the workforce pool provider. You cannot use a disabled provider to exchange tokens. However, existing tokens still grant access. display-name=ea A user-specified display name for the provider. Cannot exceed 32 characters. expire-time=dolor Output only. Time after which the workload pool provider will be permanently purged and cannot be recovered. name=lorem Output only. The resource name of the provider. Format: locations/{location}/workforcePools/{workforce_pool_id}/providers/{provider_id} oidc client-id=eos Required. The client ID. Must match the audience claim of the JWT issued by the identity provider. client-secret.value plain-text=labore Input only. The plain text of the client secret value. For security reasons, this field is only used for input and will never be populated in any response. thumbprint=sed Output only. A thumbprint to represent the current client secret value. ... issuer-uri=duo Required. The OIDC issuer URI. Must be a valid URI using the 'https' scheme. jwks-json=sed OIDC JWKs in JSON String format. For details on the definition of a JWK, see https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7517. If not set, the jwks_uri from the discovery document(fetched from the .well-known path of the issuer_uri ) will be used. Currently, RSA and EC asymmetric keys are supported. The JWK must use following format and include only the following fields: { \"keys\": [ { \"kty\": \"RSA/EC\", \"alg\": \"\", \"use\": \"sig\", \"kid\": \"\", \"n\": \"\", \"e\": \"\", \"x\": \"\", \"y\": \"\", \"crv\": \"\" } ] } web-sso-config additional-scopes=no Additional scopes to request for in the OIDC authentication request on top of scopes requested by default. By default, the openid , profile and email scopes that are supported by the identity provider are requested. Each additional scope may be at most 256 characters. A maximum of 10 additional scopes may be configured. Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. assertion-claims-behavior=stet Required. The behavior for how OIDC Claims are included in the assertion object used for attribute mapping and attribute condition. response-type=kasd Required. The Response Type to request for in the OIDC Authorization Request for web sign-in. The CODE Response Type is recommended to avoid the Implicit Flow, for security reasons. ...saml idp-metadata-xml=et Required. SAML Identity provider configuration metadata xml doc. The xml document should comply with SAML 2.0 specification . The max size of the acceptable xml document will be bounded to 128k characters. The metadata xml document should satisfy the following constraints: 1) Must contain an Identity Provider Entity ID. 2) Must contain at least one non-expired signing key certificate. 3) For each signing key: a) Valid from should be no more than 7 days from now. b) Valid to should be no more than 15 years in the future. 4) Up to 3 IdP signing keys are allowed in the metadata xml. When updating the provider's metadata xml, at least one non-expired signing key must overlap with the existing metadata. This requirement is skipped if there are no non-expired signing keys present in the existing metadata. .. state=sed Output only.

Each field may be a simple scalar or another data-structure. In the latter case it is advised to set the field-cursor to the data-structure's field to specify values more concisely. For example, a structure like this: WorkforcePoolProvider: attribute-condition: string attribute-mapping: { string: string } description: string disabled: boolean display-name: string expire-time: string name: string oidc: client-id: string client-secret: value: plain-text: string thumbprint: string issuer-uri: string jwks-json: string web-sso-config: additional-scopes: [string] assertion-claims-behavior: string response-type: string saml: idp-metadata-xml: string state: string can be set completely with the following arguments which are assumed to be executed in the given order. Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time. -r . attribute-condition=amet. A Common Expression Language expression, in plain text, to restrict what otherwise valid authentication credentials issued by the provider should not be accepted. The expression must output a boolean representing whether to allow the federation. The following keywords may be referenced in the expressions: * assertion : JSON representing the authentication credential issued by the provider. * google : The Google attributes mapped from the assertion in the attribute_mappings . google.profile_photo , google.display_name and google.posix_username are not supported. * attribute : The custom attributes mapped from the assertion in the attribute_mappings . The maximum length of the attribute condition expression is 4096 characters. If unspecified, all valid authentication credentials will be accepted. The following example shows how to only allow credentials with a mapped google.groups value of admins : &#34;&#39;admins&#39; in google.groups&#34; attribute-mapping=key=consetetur Required. Maps attributes from the authentication credentials issued by an external identity provider to Google Cloud attributes, such as subject and segment . Each key must be a string specifying the Google Cloud IAM attribute to map to. The following keys are supported: * google.subject : The principal IAM is authenticating. You can reference this value in IAM bindings. This is also the subject that appears in Cloud Logging logs. This is a required field and the mapped subject cannot exceed 127 bytes. * google.groups : Groups the authenticating user belongs to. You can grant groups access to resources using an IAM principalSet binding; access applies to all members of the group. * google.display_name : The name of the authenticated user. This is an optional field and the mapped display name cannot exceed 100 bytes. If not set, google.subject will be displayed instead. This attribute cannot be referenced in IAM bindings. * google.profile_photo : The URL that specifies the authenticated user's thumbnail photo. This is an optional field. When set, the image will be visible as the user's profile picture. If not set, a generic user icon will be displayed instead. This attribute cannot be referenced in IAM bindings. * google.posix_username : The linux username used by OS login. This is an optional field and the mapped posix username cannot exceed 32 characters, The key must match the regex \"^a-zA-Z0-9. {0,31}$\". This attribute cannot be referenced in IAM bindings. You can also provide custom attributes by specifying attribute.{custom_attribute} , where {custom_attribute} is the name of the custom attribute to be mapped. You can define a maximum of 50 custom attributes. The maximum length of a mapped attribute key is 100 characters, and the key may only contain the characters [a-z0-9 ]. You can reference these attributes in IAM policies to define fine-grained access for a workforce pool to Google Cloud resources. For example: * google.subject : principal://iam.googleapis.com/locations/global/workforcePools/{pool}/subject/{value} * google.groups : principalSet://iam.googleapis.com/locations/global/workforcePools/{pool}/group/{value} * attribute.{custom_attribute} : principalSet://iam.googleapis.com/locations/global/workforcePools/{pool}/attribute.{custom_attribute}/{value} Each value must be a [Common Expression Language] (https://opensource.google/projects/cel) function that maps an identity provider credential to the normalized attribute specified by the corresponding map key. You can use the assertion keyword in the expression to access a JSON representation of the authentication credential issued by the provider. The maximum length of an attribute mapping expression is 2048 characters. When evaluated, the total size of all mapped attributes must not exceed 4KB. For OIDC providers, you must supply a custom mapping that includes the google.subject attribute. For example, the following maps the sub claim of the incoming credential to the subject attribute on a Google token: {&#34;google.subject&#34;: &#34;assertion.sub&#34;} the value will be associated with the given key description=diam A user-specified description of the provider. Cannot exceed 256 characters. disabled=true Disables the workforce pool provider. You cannot use a disabled provider to exchange tokens. However, existing tokens still grant access. display-name=et A user-specified display name for the provider. Cannot exceed 32 characters. expire-time=et Output only. Time after which the workload pool provider will be permanently purged and cannot be recovered. name=sadipscing Output only. The resource name of the provider. Format: locations/{location}/workforcePools/{workforce_pool_id}/providers/{provider_id} oidc client-id=stet Required. The client ID. Must match the audience claim of the JWT issued by the identity provider. client-secret.value plain-text=dolor Input only. The plain text of the client secret value. For security reasons, this field is only used for input and will never be populated in any response. thumbprint=duo Output only. A thumbprint to represent the current client secret value. ... issuer-uri=vero Required. The OIDC issuer URI. Must be a valid URI using the 'https' scheme. jwks-json=vero OIDC JWKs in JSON String format. For details on the definition of a JWK, see https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7517. If not set, the jwks_uri from the discovery document(fetched from the .well-known path of the issuer_uri ) will be used. Currently, RSA and EC asymmetric keys are supported. The JWK must use following format and include only the following fields: { \"keys\": [ { \"kty\": \"RSA/EC\", \"alg\": \"\", \"use\": \"sig\", \"kid\": \"\", \"n\": \"\", \"e\": \"\", \"x\": \"\", \"y\": \"\", \"crv\": \"\" } ] } web-sso-config additional-scopes=invidunt Additional scopes to request for in the OIDC authentication request on top of scopes requested by default. By default, the openid , profile and email scopes that are supported by the identity provider are requested. Each additional scope may be at most 256 characters. A maximum of 10 additional scopes may be configured. Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. assertion-claims-behavior=stet Required. The behavior for how OIDC Claims are included in the assertion object used for attribute mapping and attribute condition. response-type=vero Required. The Response Type to request for in the OIDC Authorization Request for web sign-in. The CODE Response Type is recommended to avoid the Implicit Flow, for security reasons. ...saml idp-metadata-xml=elitr Required. SAML Identity provider configuration metadata xml doc. The xml document should comply with SAML 2.0 specification . The max size of the acceptable xml document will be bounded to 128k characters. The metadata xml document should satisfy the following constraints: 1) Must contain an Identity Provider Entity ID. 2) Must contain at least one non-expired signing key certificate. 3) For each signing key: a) Valid from should be no more than 7 days from now. b) Valid to should be no more than 15 years in the future. 4) Up to 3 IdP signing keys are allowed in the metadata xml. When updating the provider's metadata xml, at least one non-expired signing key must overlap with the existing metadata. This requirement is skipped if there are no non-expired signing keys present in the existing metadata. .. state=lorem Output only. The state of the provider. About Cursors The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. . Each additional . moves it up one additional level. E.g. ... would go three levels up. Optional Output Flags The method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default. -o out out specifies the destination to which to write the server's result to.

For example, a structure like this: SetIamPolicyRequest: policy: etag: string version: integer update-mask: string can be set completely with the following arguments which are assumed to be executed in the given order. Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time. -r .policy etag=diam etag is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help prevent simultaneous updates of a policy from overwriting each other. It is strongly suggested that systems make use of the etag in the read-modify-write cycle to perform policy updates in order to avoid race conditions: An etag is returned in the response to getIamPolicy , and systems are expected to put that etag in the request to setIamPolicy to ensure that their change will be applied to the same version of the policy. Important: If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the etag field whenever you call setIamPolicy . If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to overwrite a version 3 policy with a version 1 policy, and all of the conditions in the version 3 policy are lost. version=40 Specifies the format of the policy. Valid values are 0 , 1 , and 3 . Requests that specify an invalid value are rejected. Any operation that affects conditional role bindings must specify version 3 . This requirement applies to the following operations: * Getting a policy that includes a conditional role binding * Adding a conditional role binding to a policy * Changing a conditional role binding in a policy * Removing any role binding, with or without a condition, from a policy that includes conditions Important: If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the etag field whenever you call setIamPolicy . If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to overwrite a version 3 policy with a version 1 policy, and all of the conditions in the version 3 policy are lost. If a policy does not include any conditions, operations on that policy may specify any valid version or leave the field unset. To learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the IAM documentation . .. update-mask=ipsum OPTIONAL: A FieldMask specifying which fields of the policy to modify. Only the fields in the mask will be modified. If no mask is provided, the following default mask is used: paths: &#34;bindings, etag&#34; About Cursors The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. . Each additional . moves it up one additional level. E.g. ... would go three levels up.

About Cursors The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. . Each additional . moves it up one additional level. E.g. ... would go three levels up. Optional Output Flags The method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default. -o out out specifies the destination to which to write the server's result to. It will be a JSON-encoded structure. The destination may be - to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes. If unset, it defaults to standard output.

Each key must be a string specifying the Google Cloud IAM attribute to map to. The following keys are supported: * google.subject : The principal IAM is authenticating. You can reference this value in IAM bindings. This is also the subject that appears in Cloud Logging logs. Cannot exceed 127 bytes. * google.groups : Groups the external identity belongs to. You can grant groups access to resources using an IAM principalSet binding; access applies to all members of the group.

In the latter case it is advised to set the field-cursor to the data-structure's field to specify values more concisely. For example, a structure like this: WorkloadIdentityPoolProvider: attribute-condition: string attribute-mapping: { string: string } aws: account-id: string description: string disabled: boolean display-name: string expire-time: string name: string oidc: allowed-audiences: [string] issuer-uri: string jwks-json: string saml: idp-metadata-xml: string state: string can be set completely with the following arguments which are assumed to be executed in the given order. Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time. -r . attribute-condition=et A Common Expression Language expression, in plain text, to restrict what otherwise valid authentication credentials issued by the provider should not be accepted. The expression must output a boolean representing whether to allow the federation. The following keywords may be referenced in the expressions: * assertion : JSON representing the authentication credential issued by the provider. * google : The Google attributes mapped from the assertion in the attribute_mappings . * attribute : The custom attributes mapped from the assertion in the attribute_mappings . The maximum length of the attribute condition expression is 4096 characters. If unspecified, all valid authentication credential are accepted. The following example shows how to only allow credentials with a mapped google.groups value of admins : &#34;&#39;admins&#39; in google.groups&#34; attribute-mapping=key=sea Maps attributes from authentication credentials issued by an external identity provider to Google Cloud attributes, such as subject and segment . Each key must be a string specifying the Google Cloud IAM attribute to map to. The following keys are supported: * google.subject : The principal IAM is authenticating. You can reference this value in IAM bindings. This is also the subject that appears in Cloud Logging logs. Cannot exceed 127 bytes. * google.groups : Groups the external identity belongs to. You can grant groups access to resources using an IAM principalSet binding; access applies to all members of the group. You can also provide custom attributes by specifying attribute.{custom_attribute} , where {custom_attribute} is the name of the custom attribute to be mapped. You can define a maximum of 50 custom attributes. The maximum length of a mapped attribute key is 100 characters, and the key may only contain the characters [a-z0-9_]. You can reference these attributes in IAM policies to define fine-grained access for a workload to Google Cloud resources. For example: * google.subject : principal://iam.googleapis.com/projects/{project}/locations/{location}/workloadIdentityPools/{pool}/subject/{value} * google.groups : principalSet://iam.googleapis.com/projects/{project}/locations/{location}/workloadIdentityPools/{pool}/group/{value} * attribute.{custom_attribute} : principalSet://iam.googleapis.com/projects/{project}/locations/{location}/workloadIdentityPools/{pool}/attribute.{custom_attribute}/{value} Each value must be a [Common Expression Language] (https://opensource.google/projects/cel) function that maps an identity provider credential to the normalized attribute specified by the corresponding map key. You can use the assertion keyword in the expression to access a JSON representation of the authentication credential issued by the provider. The maximum length of an attribute mapping expression is 2048 characters. When evaluated, the total size of all mapped attributes must not exceed 8KB. For AWS providers, if no attribute mapping is defined, the following default mapping applies: { &#34;google.subject&#34;:&#34;assertion.arn&#34;, &#34;attribute.aws_role&#34;: &#34;assertion.arn.contains(&#39;assumed-role&#39;)&#34; &#34; ? assertion.arn.extract(&#39;{account_arn}assumed-role/&#39;)&#34; &#34; + &#39;assumed-role/&#39;&#34; &#34; + assertion.arn.extract(&#39;assumed-role/{role_name}/&#39;)&#34; &#34; : assertion.arn&#34;, } If any custom attribute mappings are defined, they must include a mapping to the google.subject attribute. For OIDC providers, you must supply a custom mapping, which must include the google.subject attribute. For example, the following maps the sub claim of the incoming credential to the subject attribute on a Google token: {&#34;google.subject&#34;: &#34;assertion.sub&#34;} the value will be associated with the given key aws account-id=consetetur Required. The AWS account ID. .. description=consetetur A description for the provider. Cannot exceed 256 characters. disabled=true Whether the provider is disabled. You cannot use a disabled provider to exchange tokens. However, existing tokens still grant access. display-name=est A display name for the provider. Cannot exceed 32 characters. expire-time=aliquyam Output only. Time after which the workload identity pool provider will be permanently purged and cannot be recovered. name=elitr Output only. The resource name of the provider. oidc allowed-audiences=duo Acceptable values for the aud field (audience) in the OIDC token. Token exchange requests are rejected if the token audience does not match one of the configured values. Each audience may be at most 256 characters. A maximum of 10 audiences may be configured. If this list is empty, the OIDC token audience must be equal to the full canonical resource name of the WorkloadIdentityPoolProvider, with or without the HTTPS prefix. For example: //iam.googleapis.com/projects//locations//workloadIdentityPools//providers/ https://iam.googleapis.com/projects//locations//workloadIdentityPools//providers/ Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. issuer-uri=diam Required.

For example, a structure like this: WorkloadIdentityPoolProvider: attribute-condition: string attribute-mapping: { string: string } aws: account-id: string description: string disabled: boolean display-name: string expire-time: string name: string oidc: allowed-audiences: [string] issuer-uri: string jwks-json: string saml: idp-metadata-xml: string state: string can be set completely with the following arguments which are assumed to be executed in the given order. Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time. -r . attribute-condition=et A Common Expression Language expression, in plain text, to restrict what otherwise valid authentication credentials issued by the provider should not be accepted. The expression must output a boolean representing whether to allow the federation. The following keywords may be referenced in the expressions: * assertion : JSON representing the authentication credential issued by the provider. * google : The Google attributes mapped from the assertion in the attribute_mappings . * attribute : The custom attributes mapped from the assertion in the attribute_mappings . The maximum length of the attribute condition expression is 4096 characters. If unspecified, all valid authentication credential are accepted. The following example shows how to only allow credentials with a mapped google.groups value of admins : &#34;&#39;admins&#39; in google.groups&#34; attribute-mapping=key=sea Maps attributes from authentication credentials issued by an external identity provider to Google Cloud attributes, such as subject and segment . Each key must be a string specifying the Google Cloud IAM attribute to map to. The following keys are supported: * google.subject : The principal IAM is authenticating. You can reference this value in IAM bindings. This is also the subject that appears in Cloud Logging logs. Cannot exceed 127 bytes. * google.groups : Groups the external identity belongs to. You can grant groups access to resources using an IAM principalSet binding; access applies to all members of the group. You can also provide custom attributes by specifying attribute.{custom_attribute} , where {custom_attribute} is the name of the custom attribute to be mapped. You can define a maximum of 50 custom attributes. The maximum length of a mapped attribute key is 100 characters, and the key may only contain the characters [a-z0-9_]. You can reference these attributes in IAM policies to define fine-grained access for a workload to Google Cloud resources. For example: * google.subject : principal://iam.googleapis.com/projects/{project}/locations/{location}/workloadIdentityPools/{pool}/subject/{value} * google.groups : principalSet://iam.googleapis.com/projects/{project}/locations/{location}/workloadIdentityPools/{pool}/group/{value} * attribute.{custom_attribute} : principalSet://iam.googleapis.com/projects/{project}/locations/{location}/workloadIdentityPools/{pool}/attribute.{custom_attribute}/{value} Each value must be a [Common Expression Language] (https://opensource.google/projects/cel) function that maps an identity provider credential to the normalized attribute specified by the corresponding map key. You can use the assertion keyword in the expression to access a JSON representation of the authentication credential issued by the provider. The maximum length of an attribute mapping expression is 2048 characters. When evaluated, the total size of all mapped attributes must not exceed 8KB. For AWS providers, if no attribute mapping is defined, the following default mapping applies: { &#34;google.subject&#34;:&#34;assertion.arn&#34;, &#34;attribute.aws_role&#34;: &#34;assertion.arn.contains(&#39;assumed-role&#39;)&#34; &#34; ? assertion.arn.extract(&#39;{account_arn}assumed-role/&#39;)&#34; &#34; + &#39;assumed-role/&#39;&#34; &#34; + assertion.arn.extract(&#39;assumed-role/{role_name}/&#39;)&#34; &#34; : assertion.arn&#34;, } If any custom attribute mappings are defined, they must include a mapping to the google.subject attribute. For OIDC providers, you must supply a custom mapping, which must include the google.subject attribute. For example, the following maps the sub claim of the incoming credential to the subject attribute on a Google token: {&#34;google.subject&#34;: &#34;assertion.sub&#34;} the value will be associated with the given key aws account-id=consetetur Required. The AWS account ID. .. description=consetetur A description for the provider. Cannot exceed 256 characters. disabled=true Whether the provider is disabled. You cannot use a disabled provider to exchange tokens. However, existing tokens still grant access. display-name=est A display name for the provider.

The resource name of the provider. oidc allowed-audiences=duo Acceptable values for the aud field (audience) in the OIDC token.

Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time. -r .policy etag=dolor etag is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help prevent simultaneous updates of a policy from overwriting each other. It is strongly suggested that systems make use of the etag in the read-modify-write cycle to perform policy updates in order to avoid race conditions: An etag is returned in the response to getIamPolicy , and systems are expected to put that etag in the request to setIamPolicy to ensure that their change will be applied to the same version of the policy. Important: If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the etag field whenever you call setIamPolicy . If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to overwrite a version 3 policy with a version 1 policy, and all of the conditions in the version 3 policy are lost. version=69 Specifies the format of the policy. Valid values are 0 , 1 , and 3 . Requests that specify an invalid value are rejected. Any operation that affects conditional role bindings must specify version 3 . This requirement applies to the following operations: * Getting a policy that includes a conditional role binding * Adding a conditional role binding to a policy * Changing a conditional role binding in a policy * Removing any role binding, with or without a condition, from a policy that includes conditions Important: If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the etag field whenever you call setIamPolicy . If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to overwrite a version 3 policy with a version 1 policy, and all of the conditions in the version 3 policy are lost. If a policy does not include any conditions, operations on that policy may specify any valid version or leave the field unset.

Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time. -r . full-resource-name=rebum. Required. The full resource name to query from the list of grantable roles. The name follows the Google Cloud Platform resource format. For example, a Cloud Platform project with id my-project will be named //cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com/projects/my-project . page-size=97 Optional limit on the number of roles to include in the response. The default is 300, and the maximum is 1,000. page-token=lorem Optional pagination token returned in an earlier QueryGrantableRolesResponse. view=justo No description provided.","title":"Required Request Value"},{"location":"roles_query-grantable-roles/#about-cursors","text":"The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. .
