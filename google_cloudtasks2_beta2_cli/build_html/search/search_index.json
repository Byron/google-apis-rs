By default all output is printed to standard out, but flags can be set to direct it into a file independent of your shell's capabilities. Errors will be printed to standard error, and cause the program's exit code to be non-zero. If data-structures are requested, these will be returned as pretty-printed JSON, to be useful as input to other tools. Everything else about the Cloud Tasks API can be found at the official documentation site . Installation and Source Code Install the command-line interface with cargo using: cargo install google-cloudtasks2_beta2-cli Find the source code on github .

Specify the authentication a method should be executed in. Each scope requires the user to grant this application permission to use it. If unset, it defaults to the shortest scope url for a particular method. --config-dir <folder> A directory into which we will store our persistent data. Defaults to a user-writable directory that we will create during the first invocation. [default: ~/.google-service-cli] Configuration The program will store all persistent data in the ~/.google-service-cli directory in JSON files prefixed with cloudtasks2-beta2- . You can change the directory used to store configuration with the --config-dir flag on a per-invocation basis. More information about the various kinds of persistent data are given in the following paragraphs. Authentication Most APIs require a user to authenticate any request. If this is the case, the scope determines the set of permissions granted. The granularity of these is usually no more than read-only or full-access . If not set, the system will automatically select the smallest feasible scope, e.g. when invoking a method that is read-only, it will ask only for a read-only scope. You may use the --scope flag to specify a scope directly. All applicable scopes are documented in the respective method's CLI documentation. The first time a scope is used, the user is asked for permission. Follow the instructions given by the CLI to grant permissions, or to decline. If a scope was authenticated by the user, the respective information will be stored as JSON in the configuration directory, e.g. ~/.google-service-cli/cloudtasks2-beta2-token-<scope-hash>.json . No manual management of these tokens is necessary. To revoke granted authentication, please refer to the official documentation . Application Secrets In order to allow any application to use Google services, it will need to be registered using the Google Developer Console . APIs the application may use are then enabled for it one by one. Most APIs can be used for free and have a daily quota. To allow more comfortable usage of the CLI without forcing anyone to register an own application, the CLI comes with a default application secret that is configured accordingly. This also means that heavy usage all around the world may deplete the daily quota. You can workaround this limitation by putting your own secrets file at this location: ~/.google-service-cli/cloudtasks2-beta2-secret.json , assuming that the required cloudtasks API was enabled for it. Such a secret file can be downloaded in the Google Developer Console at APIs & auth -> Credentials -> Download JSON and used as is. Learn more about how to setup Google projects and enable APIs using the official documentation . Debugging Even though the CLI does its best to provide usable error messages, sometimes it might be desirable to know what exactly led to a particular issue. This is done by allowing all client-server communication to be output to standard error as-is . The --debug flag will print errors using the Debug representation to standard error. You may consider redirecting standard error into a file for ease of use, e.g. cloudtasks2-beta2 --debug <resource> <method> [options] 2>debug.txt .","title":"Home"},{"location":"#installation-and-source-code","text":"Install the command-line interface with cargo using: cargo install google-cloudtasks2_beta2-cli Find the source code on github .","title":"Installation and Source Code"},{"location":"#usage","text":"This documentation was generated from the Cloud Tasks API at revision 20240223 .

You can set the scope for this method like this: cloudtasks2-beta2 --scope <scope> api queue-update ... Required Request Value The request value is a data-structure with various fields. Each field may be a simple scalar or another data-structure. In the latter case it is advised to set the field-cursor to the data-structure's field to specify values more concisely. For example, a structure like this: HttpBody: content-type: string data: string can be set completely with the following arguments which are assumed to be executed in the given order. Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time. -r . content-type=et The HTTP Content-Type header value specifying the content type of the body. data=magna The HTTP request/response body as raw binary. About Cursors The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. .

For more information, see https://cloud.google.com/about/locations/. * QUEUE_ID can contain letters ([A-Za-z]), numbers ([0-9]), or hyphens (-). The maximum length is 100 characters. purge-time=ea Output only. The last time this queue was purged. All tasks that were created before this time were purged. A queue can be purged using PurgeQueue, the App Engine Task Queue SDK, or the Cloud Console . Purge time will be truncated to the nearest microsecond. Purge time will be unset if the queue has never been purged. rate-limits max-burst-size=46 The max burst size. Max burst size limits how fast tasks in queue are processed when many tasks are in the queue and the rate is high. This field allows the queue to have a high rate so processing starts shortly after a task is enqueued, but still limits resource usage when many tasks are enqueued in a short period of time. The token bucket algorithm is used to control the rate of task dispatches. Each queue has a token bucket that holds tokens, up to the maximum specified by max_burst_size . Each time a task is dispatched, a token is removed from the bucket. Tasks will be dispatched until the queue's bucket runs out of tokens. The bucket will be continuously refilled with new tokens based on max_dispatches_per_second. The default value of max_burst_size is picked by Cloud Tasks based on the value of max_dispatches_per_second. The maximum value of max_burst_size is 500. For App Engine queues that were created or updated using queue.yaml/xml , max_burst_size is equal to bucket_size . If UpdateQueue is called on a queue without explicitly setting a value for max_burst_size , max_burst_size value will get updated if UpdateQueue is updating max_dispatches_per_second. max-concurrent-tasks=13 The maximum number of concurrent tasks that Cloud Tasks allows to be dispatched for this queue. After this threshold has been reached, Cloud Tasks stops dispatching tasks until the number of concurrent requests decreases. If unspecified when the queue is created, Cloud Tasks will pick the default. The maximum allowed value is 5,000. This field is output only for pull queues and always -1, which indicates no limit. No other queue types can have max_concurrent_tasks set to -1. This field has the same meaning as max_concurrent_requests in queue.yaml/xml . max-tasks-dispatched-per-second=0.42548765853373427 The maximum rate at which tasks are dispatched from this queue. If unspecified when the queue is created, Cloud Tasks will pick the default. * For App Engine queues, the maximum allowed value is 500. * This field is output only for pull queues. In addition to the max_tasks_dispatched_per_second limit, a maximum of 10 QPS of LeaseTasks requests are allowed per pull queue. This field has the same meaning as rate in queue.yaml/xml . ..retry-config max-attempts=81 The maximum number of attempts for a task. Cloud Tasks will attempt the task max_attempts times (that is, if the first attempt fails, then there will be max_attempts - 1 retries). Must be > 0. max-backoff=ipsum A task will be scheduled for retry between min_backoff and max_backoff duration after it fails, if the queue's RetryConfig specifies that the task should be retried. If unspecified when the queue is created, Cloud Tasks will pick the default. This field is output only for pull queues. max_backoff will be truncated to the nearest second. This field has the same meaning as max_backoff_seconds in queue.yaml/xml . max-doublings=8 The time between retries will double max_doublings times. A task's retry interval starts at min_backoff, then doubles max_doublings times, then increases linearly, and finally retries at intervals of max_backoff up to max_attempts times. For example, if min_backoff is 10s, max_backoff is 300s, and max_doublings is 3, then the a task will first be retried in 10s. The retry interval will double three times, and then increase linearly by 2^3 * 10s. Finally, the task will retry at intervals of max_backoff until the task has been attempted max_attempts times. Thus, the requests will retry at 10s, 20s, 40s, 80s, 160s, 240s, 300s, 300s, .... If unspecified when the queue is created, Cloud Tasks will pick the default. This field is output only for pull queues. This field has the same meaning as max_doublings in queue.yaml/xml . max-retry-duration=ut If positive, max_retry_duration specifies the time limit for retrying a failed task, measured from when the task was first attempted. Once max_retry_duration time has passed and the task has been attempted max_attempts times, no further attempts will be made and the task will be deleted. If zero, then the task age is unlimited. If unspecified when the queue is created, Cloud Tasks will pick the default. This field is output only for pull queues. max_retry_duration will be truncated to the nearest second. This field has the same meaning as task_age_limit in queue.yaml/xml . min-backoff=gubergren A task will be scheduled for retry between min_backoff and max_backoff duration after it fails, if the queue's RetryConfig specifies that the task should be retried. If unspecified when the queue is created, Cloud Tasks will pick the default. This field is output only for pull queues. min_backoff will be truncated to the nearest second. This field has the same meaning as min_backoff_seconds in queue.yaml/xml . unlimited-attempts=true If true, then the number of attempts is unlimited. .. state=ipsum Output only. The state of the queue. state can only be changed by called PauseQueue, ResumeQueue, or uploading queue.yaml/xml . UpdateQueue cannot be used to change state . stats concurrent-dispatches-count=-50 Output only. The number of requests that the queue has dispatched but has not received a reply for yet. effective-execution-rate=0.8016125465746553 Output only. The current maximum number of tasks per second executed by the queue. The maximum value of this variable is controlled by the RateLimits of the Queue. However, this value could be less to avoid overloading the endpoints tasks in the queue are targeting. executed-last-minute-count=-62 Output only. The number of tasks that the queue has dispatched and received a reply for during the last minute. This variable counts both successful and non-successful executions. oldest-estimated-arrival-time=ea Output only. An estimation of the nearest time in the future where a task in the queue is scheduled to be executed. tasks-count=-99 Output only. An estimation of the number of tasks in the queue, that is, the tasks in the queue that haven't been executed, the tasks in the queue which the queue has dispatched but has not yet received a reply for, and the failed tasks that the queue is retrying. .. task-ttl=lorem The maximum amount of time that a task will be retained in this queue. Queues created by Cloud Tasks have a default task_ttl of 31 days. After a task has lived for task_ttl , the task will be deleted regardless of whether it was dispatched or not. The task_ttl for queues created via queue.yaml/xml is equal to the maximum duration because there is a storage quota for these queues. To view the maximum valid duration, see the documentation for Duration. tombstone-ttl=eos The task tombstone time to live (TTL). After a task is deleted or completed, the task's tombstone is retained for the length of time specified by tombstone_ttl . The tombstone is used by task de-duplication; another task with the same name can't be created until the tombstone has expired. For more information about task de-duplication, see the documentation for CreateTaskRequest. Queues created by Cloud Tasks have a default tombstone_ttl of 1 hour. About Cursors The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. . Each additional . moves it up one additional level. E.g. ... would go three levels up.

An estimation of the nearest time in the future where a task in the queue is scheduled to be executed. tasks-count=-99 Output only. An estimation of the number of tasks in the queue, that is, the tasks in the queue that haven't been executed, the tasks in the queue which the queue has dispatched but has not yet received a reply for, and the failed tasks that the queue is retrying. .. task-ttl=lorem The maximum amount of time that a task will be retained in this queue. Queues created by Cloud Tasks have a default task_ttl of 31 days. After a task has lived for task_ttl , the task will be deleted regardless of whether it was dispatched or not. The task_ttl for queues created via queue.yaml/xml is equal to the maximum duration because there is a storage quota for these queues. To view the maximum valid duration, see the documentation for Duration. tombstone-ttl=eos The task tombstone time to live (TTL). After a task is deleted or completed, the task's tombstone is retained for the length of time specified by tombstone_ttl . The tombstone is used by task de-duplication; another task with the same name can't be created until the tombstone has expired. For more information about task de-duplication, see the documentation for CreateTaskRequest.

For example, a structure like this: Queue: app-engine-http-target: app-engine-routing-override: host: string instance: string service: string version: string http-target: http-method: string oauth-token: scope: string service-account-email: string oidc-token: audience: string service-account-email: string uri-override: host: string path-override: path: string port: string query-override: query-params: string scheme: string uri-override-enforce-mode: string name: string purge-time: string rate-limits: max-burst-size: integer max-concurrent-tasks: integer max-tasks-dispatched-per-second: number retry-config: max-attempts: integer max-backoff: string max-doublings: integer max-retry-duration: string min-backoff: string unlimited-attempts: boolean state: string stats: concurrent-dispatches-count: int64 effective-execution-rate: number executed-last-minute-count: int64 oldest-estimated-arrival-time: string tasks-count: int64 task-ttl: string tombstone-ttl: string can be set completely with the following arguments which are assumed to be executed in the given order. Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time. -r .app-engine-http-target.app-engine-routing-override host=sed Output only. The host that the task is sent to. For more information, see How Requests are Routed . The host is constructed as: * host = [application_domain_name] | [service] + &#39;.&#39; + [application_domain_name] | [version] + &#39;.&#39; + [application_domain_name] | [version_dot_service]+ &#39;.&#39; + [application_domain_name] | [instance] + &#39;.&#39; + [application_domain_name] | [instance_dot_service] + &#39;.&#39; + [application_domain_name] | [instance_dot_version] + &#39;.&#39; + [application_domain_name] | [instance_dot_version_dot_service] + &#39;.&#39; + [application_domain_name] * application_domain_name = The domain name of the app, for example .appspot.com, which is associated with the queue's project ID. Some tasks which were created using the App Engine SDK use a custom domain name. * service = service * version = version * version_dot_service = version + &#39;.&#39; + service * instance = instance * instance_dot_service = instance + &#39;.&#39; + service * instance_dot_version = instance + &#39;.&#39; + version * instance_dot_version_dot_service = instance + &#39;.&#39; + version + &#39;.&#39; + service If service is empty, then the task will be sent to the service which is the default service when the task is attempted. If version is empty, then the task will be sent to the version which is the default version when the task is attempted. If instance is empty, then the task will be sent to an instance which is available when the task is attempted. If service, version, or instance is invalid, then the task will be sent to the default version of the default service when the task is attempted. instance=duo App instance. By default, the task is sent to an instance which is available when the task is attempted. Requests can only be sent to a specific instance if manual scaling is used in App Engine Standard . App Engine Flex does not support instances. For more information, see App Engine Standard request routing and App Engine Flex request routing . service=sed App service. By default, the task is sent to the service which is the default service when the task is attempted. For some queues or tasks which were created using the App Engine Task Queue API, host is not parsable into service, version, and instance. For example, some tasks which were created using the App Engine SDK use a custom domain name; custom domains are not parsed by Cloud Tasks. If host is not parsable, then service, version, and instance are the empty string. version=no App version. By default, the task is sent to the version which is the default version when the task is attempted. For some queues or tasks which were created using the App Engine Task Queue API, host is not parsable into service, version, and instance. For example, some tasks which were created using the App Engine SDK use a custom domain name; custom domains are not parsed by Cloud Tasks. If host is not parsable, then service, version, and instance are the empty string. ...http-target http-method=stet The HTTP method to use for the request. When specified, it overrides HttpRequest for the task. Note that if the value is set to HttpMethod the HttpRequest of the task will be ignored at execution time. oauth-token scope=kasd OAuth scope to be used for generating OAuth access token. If not specified, \"https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform\" will be used. service-account-email=et Service account email to be used for generating OAuth token. The service account must be within the same project as the queue. The caller must have iam.serviceAccounts.actAs permission for the service account. ..oidc-token audience=sed Audience to be used when generating OIDC token. If not specified, the URI specified in target will be used. service-account-email=et Service account email to be used for generating OIDC token. The service account must be within the same project as the queue. The caller must have iam.serviceAccounts.actAs permission for the service account. ..uri-override host=et Host override. When specified, replaces the host part of the task URL. For example, if the task URL is \"https://www.google.com,\" and host value is set to \"example.net\", the overridden URI will be changed to \"https://example.net.\" Host value cannot be an empty string (INVALID_ARGUMENT). path-override path=vero The URI path (e.g., /users/1234). Default is an empty string. .. port=erat Port override. When specified, replaces the port part of the task URI. For instance, for a URI http://www.google.com/foo and port=123, the overridden URI becomes http://www.google.com:123/foo. Note that the port value must be a positive integer. Setting the port to 0 (Zero) clears the URI port. query-override query-params=sed The query parameters (e.g., qparam1=123&qparam2=456). Default is an empty string. .. scheme=duo Scheme override. When specified, the task URI scheme is replaced by the provided value (HTTP or HTTPS). uri-override-enforce-mode=dolore URI Override Enforce Mode When specified, determines the Target UriOverride mode. If not specified, it defaults to ALWAYS. ... name=et Caller-specified and required in CreateQueue, after which it becomes output only. The queue name. The queue name must have the following format: projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/LOCATION_ID/queues/QUEUE_ID * PROJECT_ID can contain letters ([A-Za-z]), numbers ([0-9]), hyphens (-), colons (:), or periods (.). For more information, see Identifying projects * LOCATION_ID is the canonical ID for the queue's location. The list of available locations can be obtained by calling ListLocations. For more information, see https://cloud.google.com/about/locations/. * QUEUE_ID can contain letters ([A-Za-z]), numbers ([0-9]), or hyphens (-). The maximum length is 100 characters. purge-time=voluptua. Output only. The last time this queue was purged. All tasks that were created before this time were purged. A queue can be purged using PurgeQueue, the App Engine Task Queue SDK, or the Cloud Console . Purge time will be truncated to the nearest microsecond. Purge time will be unset if the queue has never been purged. rate-limits max-burst-size=99 The max burst size. Max burst size limits how fast tasks in queue are processed when many tasks are in the queue and the rate is high. This field allows the queue to have a high rate so processing starts shortly after a task is enqueued, but still limits resource usage when many tasks are enqueued in a short period of time. The token bucket algorithm is used to control the rate of task dispatches. Each queue has a token bucket that holds tokens, up to the maximum specified by max_burst_size . Each time a task is dispatched, a token is removed from the bucket. Tasks will be dispatched until the queue's bucket runs out of tokens. The bucket will be continuously refilled with new tokens based on max_dispatches_per_second. The default value of max_burst_size is picked by Cloud Tasks based on the value of max_dispatches_per_second. The maximum value of max_burst_size is 500. For App Engine queues that were created or updated using queue.yaml/xml , max_burst_size is equal to bucket_size . If UpdateQueue is called on a queue without explicitly setting a value for max_burst_size , max_burst_size value will get updated if UpdateQueue is updating max_dispatches_per_second. max-concurrent-tasks=5 The maximum number of concurrent tasks that Cloud Tasks allows to be dispatched for this queue. After this threshold has been reached, Cloud Tasks stops dispatching tasks until the number of concurrent requests decreases. If unspecified when the queue is created, Cloud Tasks will pick the default. The maximum allowed value is 5,000. This field is output only for pull queues and always -1, which indicates no limit. No other queue types can have max_concurrent_tasks set to -1. This field has the same meaning as max_concurrent_requests in queue.yaml/xml . max-tasks-dispatched-per-second=0.07223777776561668 The maximum rate at which tasks are dispatched from this queue. If unspecified when the queue is created, Cloud Tasks will pick the default. * For App Engine queues, the maximum allowed value is 500. * This field is output only for pull queues. In addition to the max_tasks_dispatched_per_second limit, a maximum of 10 QPS of LeaseTasks requests are allowed per pull queue. This field has the same meaning as rate in queue.yaml/xml . ..retry-config max-attempts=83 The maximum number of attempts for a task. Cloud Tasks will attempt the task max_attempts times (that is, if the first attempt fails, then there will be max_attempts - 1 retries). Must be > 0. max-backoff=et A task will be scheduled for retry between min_backoff and max_backoff duration after it fails, if the queue's RetryConfig specifies that the task should be retried. If unspecified when the queue is created, Cloud Tasks will pick the default. This field is output only for pull queues. max_backoff will be truncated to the nearest second. This field has the same meaning as max_backoff_seconds in queue.yaml/xml . max-doublings=6 The time between retries will double max_doublings times. A task's retry interval starts at min_backoff, then doubles max_doublings times, then increases linearly, and finally retries at intervals of max_backoff up to max_attempts times. For example, if min_backoff is 10s, max_backoff is 300s, and max_doublings is 3, then the a task will first be retried in 10s. The retry interval will double three times, and then increase linearly by 2^3 * 10s. Finally, the task will retry at intervals of max_backoff until the task has been attempted max_attempts times. Thus, the requests will retry at 10s, 20s, 40s, 80s, 160s, 240s, 300s, 300s, .... If unspecified when the queue is created, Cloud Tasks will pick the default. This field is output only for pull queues. This field has the same meaning as max_doublings in queue.yaml/xml . max-retry-duration=stet If positive, max_retry_duration specifies the time limit for retrying a failed task, measured from when the task was first attempted. Once max_retry_duration time has passed and the task has been attempted max_attempts times, no further attempts will be made and the task will be deleted. If zero, then the task age is unlimited. If unspecified when the queue is created, Cloud Tasks will pick the default. This field is output only for pull queues. max_retry_duration will be truncated to the nearest second. This field has the same meaning as task_age_limit in queue.yaml/xml . min-backoff=dolor A task will be scheduled for retry between min_backoff and max_backoff duration after it fails, if the queue's RetryConfig specifies that the task should be retried. If unspecified when the queue is created, Cloud Tasks will pick the default. This field is output only for pull queues. min_backoff will be truncated to the nearest second. This field has the same meaning as min_backoff_seconds in queue.yaml/xml . unlimited-attempts=false If true, then the number of attempts is unlimited. .. state=vero Output only. The state of the queue. state can only be changed by called PauseQueue, ResumeQueue, or uploading queue.yaml/xml . UpdateQueue cannot be used to change state . stats concurrent-dispatches-count=-88 Output only. The number of requests that the queue has dispatched but has not received a reply for yet. effective-execution-rate=0.28492583480905564 Output only. The current maximum number of tasks per second executed by the queue. The maximum value of this variable is controlled by the RateLimits of the Queue. However, this value could be less to avoid overloading the endpoints tasks in the queue are targeting. executed-last-minute-count=-44 Output only. The number of tasks that the queue has dispatched and received a reply for during the last minute. This variable counts both successful and non-successful executions. oldest-estimated-arrival-time=lorem Output only. An estimation of the nearest time in the future where a task in the queue is scheduled to be executed. tasks-count=-29 Output only. An estimation of the number of tasks in the queue, that is, the tasks in the queue that haven't been executed, the tasks in the queue which the queue has dispatched but has not yet received a reply for, and the failed tasks that the queue is retrying. .. task-ttl=no The maximum amount of time that a task will be retained in this queue. Queues created by Cloud Tasks have a default task_ttl of 31 days. After a task has lived for task_ttl , the task will be deleted regardless of whether it was dispatched or not. The task_ttl for queues created via queue.yaml/xml is equal to the maximum duration because there is a storage quota for these queues. To view the maximum valid duration, see the documentation for Duration. tombstone-ttl=ipsum The task tombstone time to live (TTL). After a task is deleted or completed, the task's tombstone is retained for the length of time specified by tombstone_ttl . The tombstone is used by task de-duplication; another task with the same name can't be created until the tombstone has expired. For more information about task de-duplication, see the documentation for CreateTaskRequest. Queues created by Cloud Tasks have a default tombstone_ttl of 1 hour. About Cursors The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. . Each additional . moves it up one additional level. E.g. ... would go three levels up. Optional Output Flags The method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default. -o out out specifies the destination to which to write the server's result to. It will be a JSON-encoded structure. The destination may be - to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes. If unset, it defaults to standard output. Optional Method Properties You may set the following properties to further configure the call. Please note that -p is followed by one or more key-value-pairs, and is called like this -p k1=v1 k2=v2 even though the listing below repeats the -p for completeness. -p update-mask=string A mask used to specify which fields of the queue are being updated. If empty, then all fields will be updated.

Queues created by Cloud Tasks have a default task_ttl of 31 days. After a task has lived for task_ttl , the task will be deleted regardless of whether it was dispatched or not. The task_ttl for queues created via queue.yaml/xml is equal to the maximum duration because there is a storage quota for these queues. To view the maximum valid duration, see the documentation for Duration. tombstone-ttl=ipsum The task tombstone time to live (TTL). After a task is deleted or completed, the task's tombstone is retained for the length of time specified by tombstone_ttl . The tombstone is used by task de-duplication; another task with the same name can't be created until the tombstone has expired. For more information about task de-duplication, see the documentation for CreateTaskRequest. Queues created by Cloud Tasks have a default tombstone_ttl of 1 hour.","title":"Required Request Value"},{"location":"projects_locations-queues-patch/#about-cursors","text":"The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures.

It is an error to set a data payload on a task with an incompatible HttpMethod. relative-url=dolore The relative URL. The relative URL must begin with \"/\" and must be a valid HTTP relative URL. It can contain a path and query string arguments. If the relative URL is empty, then the root path \"/\" will be used. No spaces are allowed, and the maximum length allowed is 2083 characters. .. create-time=dolore Output only. The time that the task was created. create_time will be truncated to the nearest second. http-request body=dolore HTTP request body. A request body is allowed only if the HTTP method is POST, PUT, or PATCH. It is an error to set body on a task with an incompatible HttpMethod. headers=key=voluptua. HTTP request headers. This map contains the header field names and values. Headers can be set when running the task is created or task is created. These headers represent a subset of the headers that will accompany the task's HTTP request. Some HTTP request headers will be ignored or replaced. A partial list of headers that will be ignored or replaced is: * Any header that is prefixed with \"X-CloudTasks-\" will be treated as service header. Service headers define properties of the task and are predefined in CloudTask. * Host: This will be computed by Cloud Tasks and derived from HttpRequest.url. * Content-Length: This will be computed by Cloud Tasks. * User-Agent: This will be set to &#34;Google-Cloud-Tasks&#34; . * X-Google-* : Google use only. * X-AppEngine-* : Google use only. Content-Type won't be set by Cloud Tasks. You can explicitly set Content-Type to a media type when the task is created. For example, Content-Type can be set to &#34;application/octet-stream&#34; or &#34;application/json&#34; . Headers which can have multiple values (according to RFC2616) can be specified using comma-separated values. The size of the headers must be less than 80KB. the value will be associated with the given key http-method=amet. The HTTP method to use for the request. The default is POST. oauth-token scope=ea OAuth scope to be used for generating OAuth access token. If not specified, \"https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform\" will be used. service-account-email=sadipscing Service account email to be used for generating OAuth token. The service account must be within the same project as the queue. The caller must have iam.serviceAccounts.actAs permission for the service account. ..oidc-token audience=lorem Audience to be used when generating OIDC token. If not specified, the URI specified in target will be used. service-account-email=invidunt Service account email to be used for generating OIDC token. The service account must be within the same project as the queue. The caller must have iam.serviceAccounts.actAs permission for the service account. .. url=no Required. The full url path that the request will be sent to. This string must begin with either \"http://\" or \"https://\". Some examples are: http://acme.com and https://acme.com/sales:8080 . Cloud Tasks will encode some characters for safety and compatibility. The maximum allowed URL length is 2083 characters after encoding. The Location header response from a redirect response [ 300 - 399 ] may be followed. The redirect is not counted as a separate attempt. .. name=est Optionally caller-specified in CreateTask. The task name. The task name must have the following format: projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/LOCATION_ID/queues/QUEUE_ID/tasks/TASK_ID * PROJECT_ID can contain letters ([A-Za-z]), numbers ([0-9]), hyphens (-), colons (:), or periods (.). For more information, see Identifying projects * LOCATION_ID is the canonical ID for the task's location. The list of available locations can be obtained by calling ListLocations. For more information, see https://cloud.google.com/about/locations/. * QUEUE_ID can contain letters ([A-Za-z]), numbers ([0-9]), or hyphens (-). The maximum length is 100 characters. * TASK_ID can contain only letters ([A-Za-z]), numbers ([0-9]), hyphens (-), or underscores (_). The maximum length is 500 characters. pull-message payload=at A data payload consumed by the worker to execute the task. tag=sed The task's tag. Tags allow similar tasks to be processed in a batch. If you label tasks with a tag, your worker can lease tasks with the same tag using filter. For example, if you want to aggregate the events associated with a specific user once a day, you could tag tasks with the user ID. The task's tag can only be set when the task is created. The tag must be less than 500 characters. SDK compatibility: Although the SDK allows tags to be either string or bytes , only UTF-8 encoded tags can be used in Cloud Tasks. If a tag isn't UTF-8 encoded, the tag will be empty when the task is returned by Cloud Tasks. .. schedule-time=sit The time when the task is scheduled to be attempted. For App Engine queues, this is when the task will be attempted or retried. For pull queues, this is the time when the task is available to be leased; if a task is currently leased, this is the time when the current lease expires, that is, the time that the task was leased plus the lease_duration. schedule_time will be truncated to the nearest microsecond. status attempt-dispatch-count=66 Output only. The number of attempts dispatched. This count includes attempts which have been dispatched but haven't received a response. attempt-response-count=62 Output only. The number of attempts which have received a response. This field is not calculated for pull tasks. first-attempt-status dispatch-time=aliquyam Output only. The time that this attempt was dispatched. dispatch_time will be truncated to the nearest microsecond. response-status code=96 The status code, which should be an enum value of google.rpc.Code. message=et A developer-facing error message, which should be in English. Any user-facing error message should be localized and sent in the google.rpc.Status.details field, or localized by the client. .. response-time=sanctus Output only.

The time that this attempt response was received. response_time will be truncated to the nearest microsecond. schedule-time=dolores Output only. The time that this attempt was scheduled. schedule_time will be truncated to the nearest microsecond. ... view=et Output only. The view specifies which subset of the Task has been returned. About Cursors The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. . Each additional . moves it up one additional level. E.g. ... would go three levels up. Optional Output Flags The method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default. -o out out specifies the destination to which to write the server's result to. It will be a JSON-encoded structure. The destination may be - to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes. If unset, it defaults to standard output.

The response_view specifies which subset of the Task will be returned. By default response_view is BASIC; not all information is retrieved by default because some data, such as payloads, might be desirable to return only when needed because of its large size or because of the sensitivity of data that it contains. Authorization for FULL requires cloudtasks.tasks.fullView Google IAM permission on the Task resource. task.app-engine-http-request.app-engine-routing host=sed Output only.

Some tasks which were created using the App Engine SDK use a custom domain name. * service = service * version = version * version_dot_service = version + &#39;.&#39; + service * instance = instance * instance_dot_service = instance + &#39;.&#39; + service * instance_dot_version = instance + &#39;.&#39; + version * instance_dot_version_dot_service = instance + &#39;.&#39; + version + &#39;.&#39; + service If service is empty, then the task will be sent to the service which is the default service when the task is attempted. If version is empty, then the task will be sent to the version which is the default version when the task is attempted. If instance is empty, then the task will be sent to an instance which is available when the task is attempted. If service, version, or instance is invalid, then the task will be sent to the default version of the default service when the task is attempted. instance=takimata App instance. By default, the task is sent to an instance which is available when the task is attempted. Requests can only be sent to a specific instance if manual scaling is used in App Engine Standard . App Engine Flex does not support instances. For more information, see App Engine Standard request routing and App Engine Flex request routing . service=dolores App service. By default, the task is sent to the service which is the default service when the task is attempted. For some queues or tasks which were created using the App Engine Task Queue API, host is not parsable into service, version, and instance. For example, some tasks which were created using the App Engine SDK use a custom domain name; custom domains are not parsed by Cloud Tasks. If host is not parsable, then service, version, and instance are the empty string. version=gubergren App version. By default, the task is sent to the version which is the default version when the task is attempted. For some queues or tasks which were created using the App Engine Task Queue API, host is not parsable into service, version, and instance. For example, some tasks which were created using the App Engine SDK use a custom domain name; custom domains are not parsed by Cloud Tasks. If host is not parsable, then service, version, and instance are the empty string. .. headers=key=et HTTP request headers. This map contains the header field names and values. Headers can be set when the task is created. Repeated headers are not supported but a header value can contain commas. Cloud Tasks sets some headers to default values: * User-Agent : By default, this header is &#34;AppEngine-Google; (+http://code.google.com/appengine)&#34; . This header can be modified, but Cloud Tasks will append &#34;AppEngine-Google; (+http://code.google.com/appengine)&#34; to the modified User-Agent . If the task has a payload, Cloud Tasks sets the following headers: * Content-Type : By default, the Content-Type header is set to &#34;application/octet-stream&#34; . The default can be overridden by explicitly setting Content-Type to a particular media type when the task is created. For example, Content-Type can be set to &#34;application/json&#34; . * Content-Length : This is computed by Cloud Tasks. This value is output only. It cannot be changed. The headers below cannot be set or overridden: * Host * X-Google-* * X-AppEngine-* In addition, Cloud Tasks sets some headers when the task is dispatched, such as headers containing information about the task; see request headers . These headers are set only when the task is dispatched, so they are not visible when the task is returned in a Cloud Tasks response. Although there is no specific limit for the maximum number of headers or the size, there is a limit on the maximum size of the Task. For more information, see the CreateTask documentation. the value will be associated with the given key http-method=accusam The HTTP method to use for the request. The default is POST.
