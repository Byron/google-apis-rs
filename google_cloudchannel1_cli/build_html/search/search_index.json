By default all output is printed to standard out, but flags can be set to direct it into a file independent of your shell's capabilities. Errors will be printed to standard error, and cause the program's exit code to be non-zero. If data-structures are requested, these will be returned as pretty-printed JSON, to be useful as input to other tools.

Specify the authentication a method should be executed in. Each scope requires the user to grant this application permission to use it. If unset, it defaults to the shortest scope url for a particular method. --config-dir <folder> A directory into which we will store our persistent data. Defaults to a user-writable directory that we will create during the first invocation. [default: ~/.google-service-cli] Configuration The program will store all persistent data in the ~/.google-service-cli directory in JSON files prefixed with cloudchannel1- . You can change the directory used to store configuration with the --config-dir flag on a per-invocation basis. More information about the various kinds of persistent data are given in the following paragraphs. Authentication Most APIs require a user to authenticate any request. If this is the case, the scope determines the set of permissions granted. The granularity of these is usually no more than read-only or full-access . If not set, the system will automatically select the smallest feasible scope, e.g. when invoking a method that is read-only, it will ask only for a read-only scope. You may use the --scope flag to specify a scope directly. All applicable scopes are documented in the respective method's CLI documentation. The first time a scope is used, the user is asked for permission. Follow the instructions given by the CLI to grant permissions, or to decline. If a scope was authenticated by the user, the respective information will be stored as JSON in the configuration directory, e.g. ~/.google-service-cli/cloudchannel1-token-<scope-hash>.json . No manual management of these tokens is necessary. To revoke granted authentication, please refer to the official documentation . Application Secrets In order to allow any application to use Google services, it will need to be registered using the Google Developer Console . APIs the application may use are then enabled for it one by one. Most APIs can be used for free and have a daily quota. To allow more comfortable usage of the CLI without forcing anyone to register an own application, the CLI comes with a default application secret that is configured accordingly. This also means that heavy usage all around the world may deplete the daily quota. You can workaround this limitation by putting your own secrets file at this location: ~/.google-service-cli/cloudchannel1-secret.json , assuming that the required cloudchannel API was enabled for it. Such a secret file can be downloaded in the Google Developer Console at APIs & auth -> Credentials -> Download JSON and used as is. Learn more about how to setup Google projects and enable APIs using the official documentation . Debugging Even though the CLI does its best to provide usable error messages, sometimes it might be desirable to know what exactly led to a particular issue. This is done by allowing all client-server communication to be output to standard error as-is . The --debug flag will print errors using the Debug representation to standard error. You may consider redirecting standard error into a file for ease of use, e.g. cloudchannel1 --debug <resource> <method> [options] 2>debug.txt .","title":"Home"},{"location":"#installation-and-source-code","text":"Install the command-line interface with cargo using: cargo install google-cloudchannel1-cli Find the source code on github .","title":"Installation and Source Code"},{"location":"#usage","text":"This documentation was generated from the Cloudchannel API at revision 20240303 .

Call this method to set modifications for a specific ChannelPartner's bill. You can only create configs if the RepricingConfig.effective_invoice_month is a future month. If needed, you can create a config for the current month, with some restrictions. When creating a config for a future month, make sure there are no existing configs for that RepricingConfig.effective_invoice_month. The following restrictions are for creating configs in the current month. * This functionality is reserved for recovering from an erroneous config, and should not be used for regular business cases. * The new config will not modify exports used with other configs. Changes to the config may be immediate, but may take up to 24 hours. * There is a limit of ten configs for any ChannelPartner or RepricingConfig.EntitlementGranularity.entitlement, for any RepricingConfig.effective_invoice_month. * The contained ChannelPartnerRepricingConfig.repricing_config value must be different from the value used in the current config for a ChannelPartner. Possible Error Codes: * PERMISSION_DENIED: If the account making the request and the account being queried are different. * INVALID_ARGUMENT: Missing or invalid required parameters in the request. Also displays if the updated config is for the current month or past months. * NOT_FOUND: The ChannelPartnerRepricingConfig specified does not exist or is not associated with the given account. * INTERNAL: Any non-user error related to technical issues in the backend. In this case, contact Cloud Channel support. Return Value: If successful, the updated ChannelPartnerRepricingConfig resource, otherwise returns an error. Scopes You will need authorization for the https://www.googleapis.com/auth/apps.order scope to make a valid call. If unset, the scope for this method defaults to https://www.googleapis.com/auth/apps.order . You can set the scope for this method like this: cloudchannel1 --scope <scope> accounts channel-partner-links-channel-partner-repricing-configs-create ... Required Scalar Argument <parent> (string) Required. The resource name of the ChannelPartner that will receive the repricing config. Parent uses the format: accounts/{account_id}/channelPartnerLinks/{channel_partner_id} Required Request Value The request value is a data-structure with various fields. Each field may be a simple scalar or another data-structure. In the latter case it is advised to set the field-cursor to the data-structure's field to specify values more concisely. For example, a structure like this: GoogleCloudChannelV1ChannelPartnerRepricingConfig: name: string repricing-config: adjustment: percentage-adjustment: percentage: value: string effective-invoice-month: day: integer month: integer year: integer entitlement-granularity: entitlement: string rebilling-basis: string update-time: string can be set completely with the following arguments which are assumed to be executed in the given order. Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time. -r . name=et Output only. Resource name of the ChannelPartnerRepricingConfig. Format: accounts/{account_id}/channelPartnerLinks/{channel_partner_id}/channelPartnerRepricingConfigs/{id}. repricing-config.adjustment.percentage-adjustment.percentage value=magna The decimal value, as a string. The string representation consists of an optional sign, + ( U+002B ) or - ( U+002D ), followed by a sequence of zero or more decimal digits (\"the integer\"), optionally followed by a fraction, optionally followed by an exponent. An empty string should be interpreted as 0 . The fraction consists of a decimal point followed by zero or more decimal digits. The string must contain at least one digit in either the integer or the fraction. The number formed by the sign, the integer and the fraction is referred to as the significand. The exponent consists of the character e ( U+0065 ) or E ( U+0045 ) followed by one or more decimal digits. Services should normalize decimal values before storing them by: - Removing an explicitly-provided + sign ( +2.5 -> 2.5 ). - Replacing a zero-length integer value with 0 ( .5 -> 0.5 ). - Coercing the exponent character to upper-case, with explicit sign ( 2.5e8 -> 2.5E+8 ). - Removing an explicitly-provided zero exponent ( 2.5E0 -> 2.5 ). Services may perform additional normalization based on its own needs and the internal decimal implementation selected, such as shifting the decimal point and exponent value together (example: 2.5E-1 <-> 0.25 ). Additionally, services may preserve trailing zeroes in the fraction to indicate increased precision, but are not required to do so. Note that only the . character is supported to divide the integer and the fraction; , should not be supported regardless of locale. Additionally, thousand separators should not be supported. If a service does support them, values must be normalized. The ENBF grammar is: DecimalString = '' | [Sign] Significand [Exponent]; Sign = '+' | '-'; Significand = Digits '.' | [Digits] '.' Digits; Exponent = ('e' | 'E') [Sign] Digits; Digits = { '0' | '1' | '2' | '3' | '4' | '5' | '6' | '7' | '8' | '9' }; Services should clearly document the range of supported values, the maximum supported precision (total number of digits), and, if applicable, the scale (number of digits after the decimal point), as well as how it behaves when receiving out-of-bounds values. Services may choose to accept values passed as input even when the value has a higher precision or scale than the service supports, and should round the value to fit the supported scale. Alternatively, the service may error with 400 Bad Request ( INVALID_ARGUMENT in gRPC) if precision would be lost. Services should error with 400 Bad Request ( INVALID_ARGUMENT in gRPC) if the service receives a value outside of the supported range. ....effective-invoice-month day=90 Day of a month. Must be from 1 to 31 and valid for the year and month, or 0 to specify a year by itself or a year and month where the day isn't significant. month=46 Month of a year. Must be from 1 to 12, or 0 to specify a year without a month and day. year=73 Year of the date. Must be from 1 to 9999, or 0 to specify a date without a year. ..entitlement-granularity entitlement=at Resource name of the entitlement. Format: accounts/{account_id}/customers/{customer_id}/entitlements/{entitlement_id} .. rebilling-basis=sanctus Required. The RebillingBasis to use for this bill. Specifies the relative cost based on repricing costs you will apply. .. update-time=sed Output only. Timestamp of an update to the repricing rule. If update_time is after RepricingConfig.effective_invoice_month then it indicates this was set mid-month. About Cursors The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. . Each additional . moves it up one additional level. E.g. ... would go three levels up. Optional Output Flags The method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default. -o out out specifies the destination to which to write the server's result to. It will be a JSON-encoded structure. The destination may be - to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes. If unset, it defaults to standard output. Optional General Properties The following properties can configure any call, and are not specific to this method. -p $-xgafv=string V1 error format. -p access-token=string OAuth access token. -p alt=string Data format for response. -p callback=string JSONP -p fields=string Selector specifying which fields to include in a partial response. -p key=string API key. Your API key identifies your project and provides you with API access, quota, and reports. Required unless you provide an OAuth 2.0 token. -p oauth-token=string OAuth 2.0 token for the current user. -p pretty-print=boolean Returns response with indentations and line breaks. -p quota-user=string Available to use for quota purposes for server-side applications.

Resource name of the ChannelPartnerRepricingConfig. Format: accounts/{account_id}/channelPartnerLinks/{channel_partner_id}/channelPartnerRepricingConfigs/{id}. repricing-config.adjustment.percentage-adjustment.percentage value=takimata The decimal value, as a string. The string representation consists of an optional sign, + ( U+002B ) or - ( U+002D ), followed by a sequence of zero or more decimal digits (\"the integer\"), optionally followed by a fraction, optionally followed by an exponent. An empty string should be interpreted as 0 . The fraction consists of a decimal point followed by zero or more decimal digits. The string must contain at least one digit in either the integer or the fraction. The number formed by the sign, the integer and the fraction is referred to as the significand. The exponent consists of the character e ( U+0065 ) or E ( U+0045 ) followed by one or more decimal digits. Services should normalize decimal values before storing them by: - Removing an explicitly-provided + sign ( +2.5 -> 2.5 ). - Replacing a zero-length integer value with 0 ( .5 -> 0.5 ). - Coercing the exponent character to upper-case, with explicit sign ( 2.5e8 -> 2.5E+8 ). - Removing an explicitly-provided zero exponent ( 2.5E0 -> 2.5 ). Services may perform additional normalization based on its own needs and the internal decimal implementation selected, such as shifting the decimal point and exponent value together (example: 2.5E-1 <-> 0.25 ). Additionally, services may preserve trailing zeroes in the fraction to indicate increased precision, but are not required to do so. Note that only the . character is supported to divide the integer and the fraction; , should not be supported regardless of locale. Additionally, thousand separators should not be supported. If a service does support them, values must be normalized. The ENBF grammar is: DecimalString = '' | [Sign] Significand [Exponent]; Sign = '+' | '-'; Significand = Digits '.' | [Digits] '.' Digits; Exponent = ('e' | 'E') [Sign] Digits; Digits = { '0' | '1' | '2' | '3' | '4' | '5' | '6' | '7' | '8' | '9' }; Services should clearly document the range of supported values, the maximum supported precision (total number of digits), and, if applicable, the scale (number of digits after the decimal point), as well as how it behaves when receiving out-of-bounds values. Services may choose to accept values passed as input even when the value has a higher precision or scale than the service supports, and should round the value to fit the supported scale.

The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly.

If a service does support them, values must be normalized. The ENBF grammar is: DecimalString = '' | [Sign] Significand [Exponent]; Sign = '+' | '-'; Significand = Digits '.' | [Digits] '.' Digits; Exponent = ('e' | 'E') [Sign] Digits; Digits = { '0' | '1' | '2' | '3' | '4' | '5' | '6' | '7' | '8' | '9' }; Services should clearly document the range of supported values, the maximum supported precision (total number of digits), and, if applicable, the scale (number of digits after the decimal point), as well as how it behaves when receiving out-of-bounds values. Services may choose to accept values passed as input even when the value has a higher precision or scale than the service supports, and should round the value to fit the supported scale. Alternatively, the service may error with 400 Bad Request ( INVALID_ARGUMENT in gRPC) if precision would be lost. Services should error with 400 Bad Request ( INVALID_ARGUMENT in gRPC) if the service receives a value outside of the supported range. ....effective-invoice-month day=49 Day of a month.

Resource name of the customer. Format: accounts/{account_id}/customers/{customer_id} org-display-name=voluptua. Required. Name of the organization that the customer entity represents. org-postal-address address-lines=amet. Unstructured address lines describing the lower levels of an address. Because values in address_lines do not have type information and may sometimes contain multiple values in a single field (e.g. \"Austin, TX\"), it is important that the line order is clear. The order of address lines should be \"envelope order\" for the country/region of the address. In places where this can vary (e.g. Japan), address_language is used to make it explicit (e.g. \"ja\" for large-to-small ordering and \"ja-Latn\" or \"en\" for small-to-large). This way, the most specific line of an address can be selected based on the language. The minimum permitted structural representation of an address consists of a region_code with all remaining information placed in the address_lines. It would be possible to format such an address very approximately without geocoding, but no semantic reasoning could be made about any of the address components until it was at least partially resolved. Creating an address only containing a region_code and address_lines, and then geocoding is the recommended way to handle completely unstructured addresses (as opposed to guessing which parts of the address should be localities or administrative areas). Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. administrative-area=consetetur Optional. Highest administrative subdivision which is used for postal addresses of a country or region. For example, this can be a state, a province, an oblast, or a prefecture. Specifically, for Spain this is the province and not the autonomous community (e.g. \"Barcelona\" and not \"Catalonia\"). Many countries don't use an administrative area in postal addresses. E.g. in Switzerland this should be left unpopulated. language-code=diam Optional. BCP-47 language code of the contents of this address (if known). This is often the UI language of the input form or is expected to match one of the languages used in the address' country/region, or their transliterated equivalents. This can affect formatting in certain countries, but is not critical to the correctness of the data and will never affect any validation or other non-formatting related operations. If this value is not known, it should be omitted (rather than specifying a possibly incorrect default). Examples: \"zh-Hant\", \"ja\", \"ja-Latn\", \"en\". locality=dolor Optional. Generally refers to the city/town portion of the address. Examples: US city, IT comune, UK post town. In regions of the world where localities are not well defined or do not fit into this structure well, leave locality empty and use address_lines. organization=et Optional. The name of the organization at the address. postal-code=et Optional. Postal code of the address. Not all countries use or require postal codes to be present, but where they are used, they may trigger additional validation with other parts of the address (e.g. state/zip validation in the U.S.A.). recipients=sadipscing Optional. The recipient at the address. This field may, under certain circumstances, contain multiline information. For example, it might contain \"care of\" information. Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. region-code=stet Required. CLDR region code of the country/region of the address. This is never inferred and it is up to the user to ensure the value is correct. See https://cldr.unicode.org/ and https://www.unicode.org/cldr/charts/30/supplemental/territory_information.html for details. Example: \"CH\" for Switzerland. revision=2 The schema revision of the PostalAddress . This must be set to 0, which is the latest revision. All new revisions must be backward compatible with old revisions. sorting-code=duo Optional. Additional, country-specific, sorting code. This is not used in most regions. Where it is used, the value is either a string like \"CEDEX\", optionally followed by a number (e.g. \"CEDEX 7\"), or just a number alone, representing the \"sector code\" (Jamaica), \"delivery area indicator\" (Malawi) or \"post office indicator\" (e.g. C\u00f4te d'Ivoire). sublocality=vero Optional. Sublocality of the address. For example, this can be neighborhoods, boroughs, districts. ..primary-contact-info display-name=vero Output only. The customer account contact's display name, formatted as a combination of the customer's first and last name. email=invidunt The customer account's contact email. Required for entitlements that create admin.google.com accounts, and serves as the customer's username for those accounts. Use this email to invite Team customers. first-name=stet The customer account contact's first name. Optional for Team customers. last-name=vero The customer account contact's last name. Optional for Team customers. phone=elitr The customer account's contact phone number. title=lorem Optional. The customer account contact's job title. .. update-time=diam Output only. Time when the customer was updated. About Cursors The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures.

E.g. in Switzerland this should be left unpopulated. language-code=diam Optional. BCP-47 language code of the contents of this address (if known). This is often the UI language of the input form or is expected to match one of the languages used in the address' country/region, or their transliterated equivalents. This can affect formatting in certain countries, but is not critical to the correctness of the data and will never affect any validation or other non-formatting related operations. If this value is not known, it should be omitted (rather than specifying a possibly incorrect default). Examples: \"zh-Hant\", \"ja\", \"ja-Latn\", \"en\". locality=dolor Optional. Generally refers to the city/town portion of the address. Examples: US city, IT comune, UK post town. In regions of the world where localities are not well defined or do not fit into this structure well, leave locality empty and use address_lines. organization=et Optional. The name of the organization at the address. postal-code=et Optional. Postal code of the address. Not all countries use or require postal codes to be present, but where they are used, they may trigger additional validation with other parts of the address (e.g. state/zip validation in the U.S.A.). recipients=sadipscing Optional. The recipient at the address. This field may, under certain circumstances, contain multiline information. For example, it might contain \"care of\" information. Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. region-code=stet Required. CLDR region code of the country/region of the address. This is never inferred and it is up to the user to ensure the value is correct. See https://cldr.unicode.org/ and https://www.unicode.org/cldr/charts/30/supplemental/territory_information.html for details. Example: \"CH\" for Switzerland. revision=2 The schema revision of the PostalAddress . This must be set to 0, which is the latest revision. All new revisions must be backward compatible with old revisions. sorting-code=duo Optional. Additional, country-specific, sorting code. This is not used in most regions. Where it is used, the value is either a string like \"CEDEX\", optionally followed by a number (e.g. \"CEDEX 7\"), or just a number alone, representing the \"sector code\" (Jamaica), \"delivery area indicator\" (Malawi) or \"post office indicator\" (e.g. C\u00f4te d'Ivoire). sublocality=vero Optional. Sublocality of the address. For example, this can be neighborhoods, boroughs, districts. ..primary-contact-info display-name=vero Output only. The customer account contact's display name, formatted as a combination of the customer's first and last name. email=invidunt The customer account's contact email. Required for entitlements that create admin.google.com accounts, and serves as the customer's username for those accounts. Use this email to invite Team customers. first-name=stet The customer account contact's first name. Optional for Team customers. last-name=vero The customer account contact's last name. Optional for Team customers. phone=elitr The customer account's contact phone number. title=lorem Optional. The customer account contact's job title. .. update-time=diam Output only. Time when the customer was updated.","title":"Required Request Value"},{"location":"accounts_channel-partner-links-customers-create/#about-cursors","text":"The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures.

Resource name of the customer. Format: accounts/{account_id}/customers/{customer_id} org-display-name=invidunt Required. Name of the organization that the customer entity represents. org-postal-address address-lines=no Unstructured address lines describing the lower levels of an address. Because values in address_lines do not have type information and may sometimes contain multiple values in a single field (e.g. \"Austin, TX\"), it is important that the line order is clear. The order of address lines should be \"envelope order\" for the country/region of the address. In places where this can vary (e.g. Japan), address_language is used to make it explicit (e.g. \"ja\" for large-to-small ordering and \"ja-Latn\" or \"en\" for small-to-large). This way, the most specific line of an address can be selected based on the language. The minimum permitted structural representation of an address consists of a region_code with all remaining information placed in the address_lines. It would be possible to format such an address very approximately without geocoding, but no semantic reasoning could be made about any of the address components until it was at least partially resolved. Creating an address only containing a region_code and address_lines, and then geocoding is the recommended way to handle completely unstructured addresses (as opposed to guessing which parts of the address should be localities or administrative areas). Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. administrative-area=est Optional. Highest administrative subdivision which is used for postal addresses of a country or region. For example, this can be a state, a province, an oblast, or a prefecture. Specifically, for Spain this is the province and not the autonomous community (e.g. \"Barcelona\" and not \"Catalonia\"). Many countries don't use an administrative area in postal addresses. E.g. in Switzerland this should be left unpopulated. language-code=at Optional. BCP-47 language code of the contents of this address (if known). This is often the UI language of the input form or is expected to match one of the languages used in the address' country/region, or their transliterated equivalents. This can affect formatting in certain countries, but is not critical to the correctness of the data and will never affect any validation or other non-formatting related operations. If this value is not known, it should be omitted (rather than specifying a possibly incorrect default). Examples: \"zh-Hant\", \"ja\", \"ja-Latn\", \"en\". locality=sed Optional. Generally refers to the city/town portion of the address. Examples: US city, IT comune, UK post town. In regions of the world where localities are not well defined or do not fit into this structure well, leave locality empty and use address_lines. organization=sit Optional. The name of the organization at the address. postal-code=et Optional. Postal code of the address. Not all countries use or require postal codes to be present, but where they are used, they may trigger additional validation with other parts of the address (e.g. state/zip validation in the U.S.A.). recipients=tempor Optional. The recipient at the address. This field may, under certain circumstances, contain multiline information. For example, it might contain \"care of\" information. Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. region-code=aliquyam Required. CLDR region code of the country/region of the address. This is never inferred and it is up to the user to ensure the value is correct. See https://cldr.unicode.org/ and https://www.unicode.org/cldr/charts/30/supplemental/territory_information.html for details. Example: \"CH\" for Switzerland. revision=96 The schema revision of the PostalAddress . This must be set to 0, which is the latest revision. All new revisions must be backward compatible with old revisions. sorting-code=et Optional. Additional, country-specific, sorting code. This is not used in most regions. Where it is used, the value is either a string like \"CEDEX\", optionally followed by a number (e.g. \"CEDEX 7\"), or just a number alone, representing the \"sector code\" (Jamaica), \"delivery area indicator\" (Malawi) or \"post office indicator\" (e.g. C\u00f4te d'Ivoire). sublocality=sanctus Optional. Sublocality of the address. For example, this can be neighborhoods, boroughs, districts. ..primary-contact-info display-name=lorem Output only. The customer account contact's display name, formatted as a combination of the customer's first and last name. email=est The customer account's contact email. Required for entitlements that create admin.google.com accounts, and serves as the customer's username for those accounts. Use this email to invite Team customers. first-name=sed The customer account contact's first name. Optional for Team customers. last-name=diam The customer account contact's last name. Optional for Team customers. phone=dolores The customer account's contact phone number. title=dolores Optional. The customer account contact's job title. .. update-time=et Output only. Time when the customer was updated. About Cursors The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. . Each additional . moves it up one additional level. E.g. ... would go three levels up. Optional Output Flags The method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default. -o out out specifies the destination to which to write the server's result to. It will be a JSON-encoded structure. The destination may be - to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes. If unset, it defaults to standard output.

Alternate emails are optional when you create Team customers. channel-partner-id=stet Cloud Identity ID of the customer's channel partner. Populated only if a channel partner exists for this customer. cloud-identity-id=est Output only. The customer's Cloud Identity ID if the customer has a Cloud Identity resource. cloud-identity-info admin-console-uri=aliquyam Output only. URI of Customer's Admin console dashboard. alternate-email=elitr The alternate email. customer-type=duo CustomerType indicates verification type needed for using services. edu-data institute-size=diam Size of the institute. institute-type=est Designated institute type of customer. website=sit Web address for the edu customer's institution. .. is-domain-verified=false Output only.

The primary domain name. .. correlation-id=stet Optional. External CRM ID for the customer. Populated only if a CRM ID exists for this customer. create-time=dolores Output only. Time when the customer was created. domain=eos Required. The customer's primary domain. Must match the primary contact email's domain. language-code=et Optional. The BCP-47 language code, such as \"en-US\" or \"sr-Latn\". For more information, see https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr35/#Unicode_locale_identifier. name=sea Output only. Resource name of the customer. Format: accounts/{account_id}/customers/{customer_id} org-display-name=et Required. Name of the organization that the customer entity represents. org-postal-address address-lines=at Unstructured address lines describing the lower levels of an address. Because values in address_lines do not have type information and may sometimes contain multiple values in a single field (e.g. \"Austin, TX\"), it is important that the line order is clear. The order of address lines should be \"envelope order\" for the country/region of the address. In places where this can vary (e.g. Japan), address_language is used to make it explicit (e.g. \"ja\" for large-to-small ordering and \"ja-Latn\" or \"en\" for small-to-large). This way, the most specific line of an address can be selected based on the language. The minimum permitted structural representation of an address consists of a region_code with all remaining information placed in the address_lines. It would be possible to format such an address very approximately without geocoding, but no semantic reasoning could be made about any of the address components until it was at least partially resolved. Creating an address only containing a region_code and address_lines, and then geocoding is the recommended way to handle completely unstructured addresses (as opposed to guessing which parts of the address should be localities or administrative areas). Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. administrative-area=dolore Optional. Highest administrative subdivision which is used for postal addresses of a country or region. For example, this can be a state, a province, an oblast, or a prefecture. Specifically, for Spain this is the province and not the autonomous community (e.g. \"Barcelona\" and not \"Catalonia\"). Many countries don't use an administrative area in postal addresses. E.g. in Switzerland this should be left unpopulated. language-code=eirmod Optional. BCP-47 language code of the contents of this address (if known). This is often the UI language of the input form or is expected to match one of the languages used in the address' country/region, or their transliterated equivalents. This can affect formatting in certain countries, but is not critical to the correctness of the data and will never affect any validation or other non-formatting related operations. If this value is not known, it should be omitted (rather than specifying a possibly incorrect default). Examples: \"zh-Hant\", \"ja\", \"ja-Latn\", \"en\". locality=lorem Optional. Generally refers to the city/town portion of the address. Examples: US city, IT comune, UK post town. In regions of the world where localities are not well defined or do not fit into this structure well, leave locality empty and use address_lines. organization=accusam Optional. The name of the organization at the address. postal-code=amet Optional. Postal code of the address. Not all countries use or require postal codes to be present, but where they are used, they may trigger additional validation with other parts of the address (e.g. state/zip validation in the U.S.A.). recipients=erat Optional. The recipient at the address. This field may, under certain circumstances, contain multiline information. For example, it might contain \"care of\" information. Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. region-code=dolores Required. CLDR region code of the country/region of the address. This is never inferred and it is up to the user to ensure the value is correct. See https://cldr.unicode.org/ and https://www.unicode.org/cldr/charts/30/supplemental/territory_information.html for details. Example: \"CH\" for Switzerland. revision=20 The schema revision of the PostalAddress . This must be set to 0, which is the latest revision. All new revisions must be backward compatible with old revisions. sorting-code=accusam Optional. Additional, country-specific, sorting code. This is not used in most regions. Where it is used, the value is either a string like \"CEDEX\", optionally followed by a number (e.g. \"CEDEX 7\"), or just a number alone, representing the \"sector code\" (Jamaica), \"delivery area indicator\" (Malawi) or \"post office indicator\" (e.g. C\u00f4te d'Ivoire). sublocality=sea Optional. Sublocality of the address. For example, this can be neighborhoods, boroughs, districts. ..primary-contact-info display-name=takimata Output only. The customer account contact's display name, formatted as a combination of the customer's first and last name. email=lorem The customer account's contact email. Required for entitlements that create admin.google.com accounts, and serves as the customer's username for those accounts. Use this email to invite Team customers. first-name=et The customer account contact's first name. Optional for Team customers. last-name=at The customer account contact's last name. Optional for Team customers. phone=dolor The customer account's contact phone number. title=et Optional. The customer account contact's job title. .. update-time=sit Output only. Time when the customer was updated. About Cursors The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures.

URI of Customer's Admin console dashboard. alternate-email=elitr The alternate email. customer-type=duo CustomerType indicates verification type needed for using services. edu-data institute-size=diam Size of the institute. institute-type=est Designated institute type of customer. website=sit Web address for the edu customer's institution. .. is-domain-verified=false Output only. Whether the domain is verified. This field is not returned for a Customer's cloud_identity_info resource. Partners can use the domains.get() method of the Workspace SDK's Directory API, or listen to the PRIMARY_DOMAIN_VERIFIED Pub/Sub event in to track domain verification of their resolve Workspace customers. language-code=eos Language code. phone-number=lorem Phone number associated with the Cloud Identity. primary-domain=ea Output only. The primary domain name. .. correlation-id=stet Optional. External CRM ID for the customer. Populated only if a CRM ID exists for this customer. create-time=dolores Output only. Time when the customer was created. domain=eos Required. The customer's primary domain. Must match the primary contact email's domain. language-code=et Optional. The BCP-47 language code, such as \"en-US\" or \"sr-Latn\". For more information, see https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr35/#Unicode_locale_identifier. name=sea Output only. Resource name of the customer. Format: accounts/{account_id}/customers/{customer_id} org-display-name=et Required. Name of the organization that the customer entity represents. org-postal-address address-lines=at Unstructured address lines describing the lower levels of an address. Because values in address_lines do not have type information and may sometimes contain multiple values in a single field (e.g. \"Austin, TX\"), it is important that the line order is clear. The order of address lines should be \"envelope order\" for the country/region of the address. In places where this can vary (e.g. Japan), address_language is used to make it explicit (e.g. \"ja\" for large-to-small ordering and \"ja-Latn\" or \"en\" for small-to-large). This way, the most specific line of an address can be selected based on the language. The minimum permitted structural representation of an address consists of a region_code with all remaining information placed in the address_lines. It would be possible to format such an address very approximately without geocoding, but no semantic reasoning could be made about any of the address components until it was at least partially resolved. Creating an address only containing a region_code and address_lines, and then geocoding is the recommended way to handle completely unstructured addresses (as opposed to guessing which parts of the address should be localities or administrative areas). Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. administrative-area=dolore Optional. Highest administrative subdivision which is used for postal addresses of a country or region. For example, this can be a state, a province, an oblast, or a prefecture. Specifically, for Spain this is the province and not the autonomous community (e.g. \"Barcelona\" and not \"Catalonia\"). Many countries don't use an administrative area in postal addresses. E.g. in Switzerland this should be left unpopulated. language-code=eirmod Optional. BCP-47 language code of the contents of this address (if known). This is often the UI language of the input form or is expected to match one of the languages used in the address' country/region, or their transliterated equivalents. This can affect formatting in certain countries, but is not critical to the correctness of the data and will never affect any validation or other non-formatting related operations. If this value is not known, it should be omitted (rather than specifying a possibly incorrect default). Examples: \"zh-Hant\", \"ja\", \"ja-Latn\", \"en\". locality=lorem Optional. Generally refers to the city/town portion of the address. Examples: US city, IT comune, UK post town. In regions of the world where localities are not well defined or do not fit into this structure well, leave locality empty and use address_lines. organization=accusam Optional. The name of the organization at the address. postal-code=amet Optional. Postal code of the address. Not all countries use or require postal codes to be present, but where they are used, they may trigger additional validation with other parts of the address (e.g. state/zip validation in the U.S.A.). recipients=erat Optional. The recipient at the address. This field may, under certain circumstances, contain multiline information. For example, it might contain \"care of\" information. Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. region-code=dolores Required. CLDR region code of the country/region of the address. This is never inferred and it is up to the user to ensure the value is correct. See https://cldr.unicode.org/ and https://www.unicode.org/cldr/charts/30/supplemental/territory_information.html for details. Example: \"CH\" for Switzerland. revision=20 The schema revision of the PostalAddress . This must be set to 0, which is the latest revision. All new revisions must be backward compatible with old revisions. sorting-code=accusam Optional. Additional, country-specific, sorting code. This is not used in most regions. Where it is used, the value is either a string like \"CEDEX\", optionally followed by a number (e.g. \"CEDEX 7\"), or just a number alone, representing the \"sector code\" (Jamaica), \"delivery area indicator\" (Malawi) or \"post office indicator\" (e.g. C\u00f4te d'Ivoire). sublocality=sea Optional. Sublocality of the address. For example, this can be neighborhoods, boroughs, districts. ..primary-contact-info display-name=takimata Output only. The customer account contact's display name, formatted as a combination of the customer's first and last name. email=lorem The customer account's contact email. Required for entitlements that create admin.google.com accounts, and serves as the customer's username for those accounts. Use this email to invite Team customers. first-name=et The customer account contact's first name. Optional for Team customers. last-name=at The customer account contact's last name. Optional for Team customers. phone=dolor The customer account's contact phone number. title=et Optional. The customer account contact's job title. .. update-time=sit Output only.

The resource name of the customer that will receive this repricing config. Parent uses the format: accounts/{account_id}/customers/{customer_id} Required Request Value The request value is a data-structure with various fields. Each field may be a simple scalar or another data-structure. In the latter case it is advised to set the field-cursor to the data-structure's field to specify values more concisely. For example, a structure like this: GoogleCloudChannelV1CustomerRepricingConfig: name: string repricing-config: adjustment: percentage-adjustment: percentage: value: string effective-invoice-month: day: integer month: integer year: integer entitlement-granularity: entitlement: string rebilling-basis: string update-time: string can be set completely with the following arguments which are assumed to be executed in the given order. Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time. -r . name=erat Output only. Resource name of the CustomerRepricingConfig. Format: accounts/{account_id}/customers/{customer_id}/customerRepricingConfigs/{id}. repricing-config.adjustment.percentage-adjustment.percentage value=sea The decimal value, as a string. The string representation consists of an optional sign, + ( U+002B ) or - ( U+002D ), followed by a sequence of zero or more decimal digits (\"the integer\"), optionally followed by a fraction, optionally followed by an exponent. An empty string should be interpreted as 0 . The fraction consists of a decimal point followed by zero or more decimal digits. The string must contain at least one digit in either the integer or the fraction. The number formed by the sign, the integer and the fraction is referred to as the significand. The exponent consists of the character e ( U+0065 ) or E ( U+0045 ) followed by one or more decimal digits. Services should normalize decimal values before storing them by: - Removing an explicitly-provided + sign ( +2.5 -> 2.5 ). - Replacing a zero-length integer value with 0 ( .5 -> 0.5 ). - Coercing the exponent character to upper-case, with explicit sign ( 2.5e8 -> 2.5E+8 ). - Removing an explicitly-provided zero exponent ( 2.5E0 -> 2.5 ). Services may perform additional normalization based on its own needs and the internal decimal implementation selected, such as shifting the decimal point and exponent value together (example: 2.5E-1 <-> 0.25 ). Additionally, services may preserve trailing zeroes in the fraction to indicate increased precision, but are not required to do so. Note that only the . character is supported to divide the integer and the fraction; , should not be supported regardless of locale. Additionally, thousand separators should not be supported. If a service does support them, values must be normalized. The ENBF grammar is: DecimalString = '' | [Sign] Significand [Exponent]; Sign = '+' | '-'; Significand = Digits '.' | [Digits] '.' Digits; Exponent = ('e' | 'E') [Sign] Digits; Digits = { '0' | '1' | '2' | '3' | '4' | '5' | '6' | '7' | '8' | '9' }; Services should clearly document the range of supported values, the maximum supported precision (total number of digits), and, if applicable, the scale (number of digits after the decimal point), as well as how it behaves when receiving out-of-bounds values. Services may choose to accept values passed as input even when the value has a higher precision or scale than the service supports, and should round the value to fit the supported scale. Alternatively, the service may error with 400 Bad Request ( INVALID_ARGUMENT in gRPC) if precision would be lost.

Required Request Value The request value is a data-structure with various fields. Each field may be a simple scalar or another data-structure. In the latter case it is advised to set the field-cursor to the data-structure's field to specify values more concisely. For example, a structure like this: GoogleCloudChannelV1CustomerRepricingConfig: name: string repricing-config: adjustment: percentage-adjustment: percentage: value: string effective-invoice-month: day: integer month: integer year: integer entitlement-granularity: entitlement: string rebilling-basis: string update-time: string can be set completely with the following arguments which are assumed to be executed in the given order.

Resource name of the CustomerRepricingConfig. Format: accounts/{account_id}/customers/{customer_id}/customerRepricingConfigs/{id}. repricing-config.adjustment.percentage-adjustment.percentage value=aliquyam The decimal value, as a string. The string representation consists of an optional sign, + ( U+002B ) or - ( U+002D ), followed by a sequence of zero or more decimal digits (\"the integer\"), optionally followed by a fraction, optionally followed by an exponent. An empty string should be interpreted as 0 . The fraction consists of a decimal point followed by zero or more decimal digits. The string must contain at least one digit in either the integer or the fraction. The number formed by the sign, the integer and the fraction is referred to as the significand. The exponent consists of the character e ( U+0065 ) or E ( U+0045 ) followed by one or more decimal digits. Services should normalize decimal values before storing them by: - Removing an explicitly-provided + sign ( +2.5 -> 2.5 ). - Replacing a zero-length integer value with 0 ( .5 -> 0.5 ). - Coercing the exponent character to upper-case, with explicit sign ( 2.5e8 -> 2.5E+8 ). - Removing an explicitly-provided zero exponent ( 2.5E0 -> 2.5 ). Services may perform additional normalization based on its own needs and the internal decimal implementation selected, such as shifting the decimal point and exponent value together (example: 2.5E-1 <-> 0.25 ). Additionally, services may preserve trailing zeroes in the fraction to indicate increased precision, but are not required to do so. Note that only the . character is supported to divide the integer and the fraction; , should not be supported regardless of locale. Additionally, thousand separators should not be supported. If a service does support them, values must be normalized. The ENBF grammar is: DecimalString = '' | [Sign] Significand [Exponent]; Sign = '+' | '-'; Significand = Digits '.' | [Digits] '.' Digits; Exponent = ('e' | 'E') [Sign] Digits; Digits = { '0' | '1' | '2' | '3' | '4' | '5' | '6' | '7' | '8' | '9' }; Services should clearly document the range of supported values, the maximum supported precision (total number of digits), and, if applicable, the scale (number of digits after the decimal point), as well as how it behaves when receiving out-of-bounds values. Services may choose to accept values passed as input even when the value has a higher precision or scale than the service supports, and should round the value to fit the supported scale. Alternatively, the service may error with 400 Bad Request ( INVALID_ARGUMENT in gRPC) if precision would be lost.

Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time. -r . alternate-email=lorem Secondary contact email. You need to provide an alternate email to create different domains if a primary contact email already exists. Users will receive a notification with credentials when you create an admin.google.com account. Secondary emails are also recovery email addresses. Alternate emails are optional when you create Team customers. channel-partner-id=magna Cloud Identity ID of the customer's channel partner. Populated only if a channel partner exists for this customer. cloud-identity-id=takimata Output only. The customer's Cloud Identity ID if the customer has a Cloud Identity resource. cloud-identity-info admin-console-uri=rebum. Output only. URI of Customer's Admin console dashboard. alternate-email=at The alternate email. customer-type=invidunt CustomerType indicates verification type needed for using services. edu-data institute-size=clita Size of the institute. institute-type=stet Designated institute type of customer. website=aliquyam Web address for the edu customer's institution. .. is-domain-verified=false Output only. Whether the domain is verified. This field is not returned for a Customer's cloud_identity_info resource. Partners can use the domains.get() method of the Workspace SDK's Directory API, or listen to the PRIMARY_DOMAIN_VERIFIED Pub/Sub event in to track domain verification of their resolve Workspace customers. language-code=dolores Language code. phone-number=sed Phone number associated with the Cloud Identity. primary-domain=invidunt Output only. The primary domain name. .. correlation-id=clita Optional. External CRM ID for the customer. Populated only if a CRM ID exists for this customer. create-time=dolor Output only. Time when the customer was created. domain=aliquyam Required. The customer's primary domain. Must match the primary contact email's domain. language-code=magna Optional. The BCP-47 language code, such as \"en-US\" or \"sr-Latn\". For more information, see https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr35/#Unicode_locale_identifier. name=diam Output only. Resource name of the customer. Format: accounts/{account_id}/customers/{customer_id} org-display-name=nonumy Required. Name of the organization that the customer entity represents. org-postal-address address-lines=et Unstructured address lines describing the lower levels of an address. Because values in address_lines do not have type information and may sometimes contain multiple values in a single field (e.g. \"Austin, TX\"), it is important that the line order is clear. The order of address lines should be \"envelope order\" for the country/region of the address. In places where this can vary (e.g. Japan), address_language is used to make it explicit (e.g. \"ja\" for large-to-small ordering and \"ja-Latn\" or \"en\" for small-to-large). This way, the most specific line of an address can be selected based on the language. The minimum permitted structural representation of an address consists of a region_code with all remaining information placed in the address_lines. It would be possible to format such an address very approximately without geocoding, but no semantic reasoning could be made about any of the address components until it was at least partially resolved. Creating an address only containing a region_code and address_lines, and then geocoding is the recommended way to handle completely unstructured addresses (as opposed to guessing which parts of the address should be localities or administrative areas). Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. administrative-area=sanctus Optional. Highest administrative subdivision which is used for postal addresses of a country or region. For example, this can be a state, a province, an oblast, or a prefecture. Specifically, for Spain this is the province and not the autonomous community (e.g. \"Barcelona\" and not \"Catalonia\"). Many countries don't use an administrative area in postal addresses. E.g. in Switzerland this should be left unpopulated. language-code=accusam Optional. BCP-47 language code of the contents of this address (if known). This is often the UI language of the input form or is expected to match one of the languages used in the address' country/region, or their transliterated equivalents. This can affect formatting in certain countries, but is not critical to the correctness of the data and will never affect any validation or other non-formatting related operations. If this value is not known, it should be omitted (rather than specifying a possibly incorrect default). Examples: \"zh-Hant\", \"ja\", \"ja-Latn\", \"en\". locality=tempor Optional. Generally refers to the city/town portion of the address. Examples: US city, IT comune, UK post town. In regions of the world where localities are not well defined or do not fit into this structure well, leave locality empty and use address_lines. organization=sed Optional. The name of the organization at the address. postal-code=est Optional. Postal code of the address. Not all countries use or require postal codes to be present, but where they are used, they may trigger additional validation with other parts of the address (e.g. state/zip validation in the U.S.A.). recipients=takimata Optional. The recipient at the address. This field may, under certain circumstances, contain multiline information. For example, it might contain \"care of\" information. Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. region-code=dolor Required. CLDR region code of the country/region of the address. This is never inferred and it is up to the user to ensure the value is correct. See https://cldr.unicode.org/ and https://www.unicode.org/cldr/charts/30/supplemental/territory_information.html for details. Example: \"CH\" for Switzerland. revision=22 The schema revision of the PostalAddress . This must be set to 0, which is the latest revision. All new revisions must be backward compatible with old revisions. sorting-code=at Optional. Additional, country-specific, sorting code. This is not used in most regions. Where it is used, the value is either a string like \"CEDEX\", optionally followed by a number (e.g. \"CEDEX 7\"), or just a number alone, representing the \"sector code\" (Jamaica), \"delivery area indicator\" (Malawi) or \"post office indicator\" (e.g. C\u00f4te d'Ivoire). sublocality=erat Optional. Sublocality of the address. For example, this can be neighborhoods, boroughs, districts. ..primary-contact-info display-name=justo Output only. The customer account contact's display name, formatted as a combination of the customer's first and last name. email=ipsum The customer account's contact email. Required for entitlements that create admin.google.com accounts, and serves as the customer's username for those accounts. Use this email to invite Team customers. first-name=accusam The customer account contact's first name. Optional for Team customers. last-name=dolores The customer account contact's last name. Optional for Team customers. phone=consetetur The customer account's contact phone number. title=no Optional. The customer account contact's job title. .. update-time=justo Output only. Time when the customer was updated. About Cursors The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. . Each additional . moves it up one additional level. E.g. ... would go three levels up. Optional Output Flags The method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default. -o out out specifies the destination to which to write the server's result to. It will be a JSON-encoded structure. The destination may be - to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes. If unset, it defaults to standard output.
