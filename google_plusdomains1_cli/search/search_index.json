By default all output is printed to standard out, but flags can be set to direct it into a file independent of your shell's capabilities. Errors will be printed to standard error, and cause the program's exit code to be non-zero. If data-structures are requested, these will be returned as pretty-printed JSON, to be useful as input to other tools. Everything else about the plusDomains API can be found at the official documentation site . Installation and Source Code Install the command-line interface with cargo using: cargo install google-plusdomains1-cli Find the source code on github . Usage This documentation was generated from the plusDomains API at revision 20190616 . The CLI is at version 5.0.4 . plusdomains1 [options] activities get <activity-id> [-p <v>]...

Specify the authentication a method should be executed in. Each scope requires the user to grant this application permission to use it. If unset, it defaults to the shortest scope url for a particular method. --config-dir <folder> A directory into which we will store our persistent data. Defaults to a user-writable directory that we will create during the first invocation. [default: ~/.google-service-cli] Configuration The program will store all persistent data in the ~/.google-service-cli directory in JSON files prefixed with plusdomains1- . You can change the directory used to store configuration with the --config-dir flag on a per-invocation basis. More information about the various kinds of persistent data are given in the following paragraphs. Authentication Most APIs require a user to authenticate any request. If this is the case, the scope determines the set of permissions granted. The granularity of these is usually no more than read-only or full-access . If not set, the system will automatically select the smallest feasible scope, e.g. when invoking a method that is read-only, it will ask only for a read-only scope. You may use the --scope flag to specify a scope directly. All applicable scopes are documented in the respective method's CLI documentation. The first time a scope is used, the user is asked for permission. Follow the instructions given by the CLI to grant permissions, or to decline. If a scope was authenticated by the user, the respective information will be stored as JSON in the configuration directory, e.g. ~/.google-service-cli/plusdomains1-token-<scope-hash>.json . No manual management of these tokens is necessary. To revoke granted authentication, please refer to the official documentation . Application Secrets In order to allow any application to use Google services, it will need to be registered using the Google Developer Console . APIs the application may use are then enabled for it one by one. Most APIs can be used for free and have a daily quota. To allow more comfortable usage of the CLI without forcing anyone to register an own application, the CLI comes with a default application secret that is configured accordingly. This also means that heavy usage all around the world may deplete the daily quota. You can workaround this limitation by putting your own secrets file at this location: ~/.google-service-cli/plusdomains1-secret.json , assuming that the required plusDomains API was enabled for it. Such a secret file can be downloaded in the Google Developer Console at APIs & auth -> Credentials -> Download JSON and used as is. Learn more about how to setup Google projects and enable APIs using the official documentation . Debugging Even though the CLI does its best to provide usable error messages, sometimes it might be desirable to know what exactly led to a particular issue. This is done by allowing all client-server communication to be output to standard error as-is . The --debug flag will print errors using the Debug representation to standard error. You may consider redirecting standard error into a file for ease of use, e.g. plusdomains1 --debug <resource> <method> [options] 2>debug.txt .","title":"Home"},{"location":"#installation-and-source-code","text":"Install the command-line interface with cargo using: cargo install google-plusdomains1-cli Find the source code on github .","title":"Installation and Source Code"},{"location":"#usage","text":"This documentation was generated from the plusDomains API at revision 20190616 .

Required Scalar Arguments <user-id> (string) The ID of the user to create the activity on behalf of. <collection> (string) No description provided. Required Request Value The request value is a data-structure with various fields. Each field may be a simple scalar or another data-structure. In the latter case it is advised to set the field-cursor to the data-structure's field to specify values more concisely. For example, a structure like this: Media: author: display-name: string id: string image: url: string url: string display-name: string etag: string exif: time: string height: integer id: string kind: string media-created-time: string media-url: string published: string size-bytes: string summary: string updated: string url: string video-duration: string video-status: string width: integer can be set completely with the following arguments which are assumed to be executed in the given order. Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time. -r .author display-name=et The author's name. id=magna ID of the author. image url=no The URL of the author's profile photo. To resize the image and crop it to a square, append the query string ?sz=x, where x is the dimension in pixels of each side. .. url=ipsum A link to the author's Google profile. .. display-name=voluptua. The display name for this media. etag=at ETag of this response for caching purposes. exif time=sanctus The time the media was captured. Formatted as an RFC 3339 timestamp. .. height=21 The height in pixels of the original image. id=amet. ID of this media, which is generated by the API. kind=takimata The type of resource. media-created-time=amet. The time at which this media was originally created in UTC. Formatted as an RFC 3339 timestamp that matches this example: 2010-11-25T14:30:27.655Z media-url=duo The URL of this photo or video's still image. published=ipsum The time at which this media was uploaded. Formatted as an RFC 3339 timestamp. size-bytes=gubergren The size in bytes of this video. summary=lorem A description, or caption, for this media. updated=gubergren The time at which this media was last updated. This includes changes to media metadata. Formatted as an RFC 3339 timestamp. url=eos The URL for the page that hosts this media. video-duration=dolor The duration in milliseconds of this video. video-status=ea The encoding status of this video. Possible values are: \"UPLOADING\" - Not all the video bytes have been received. \"PENDING\" - Video not yet processed. \"FAILED\" - Video processing failed. \"READY\" - A single video stream is playable. \"FINAL\" - All video streams are playable. width=46 The width in pixels of the original image. About Cursors The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. . Each additional . moves it up one additional level. E.g. ... would go three levels up. Required Upload Flags This method supports the upload of data, which requires all of the following flags to be set: -u simple simple - Upload media all at once. -f file Path to file to upload. It must be seekable. The following flag may be set: -m mime the mime type, like 'application/octet-stream', which is the default Optional Output Flags The method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default. -o out out specifies the destination to which to write the server's result to.
