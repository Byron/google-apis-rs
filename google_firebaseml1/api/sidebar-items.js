If the server doesn't support this method, it returns `UNIMPLEMENTED`.

To override the binding, API services can add a binding such as `\"/v1/{name=users/*}/operations\"` to their service configuration. For backwards compatibility, the default name includes the operations collection id, however overriding users must ensure the name binding is the parent resource, without the operations collection id."],["OperationMethods","A builder providing access to all methods supported on operation resources.
