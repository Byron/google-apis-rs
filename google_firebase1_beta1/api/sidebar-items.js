Using this call, you can either: - Specify an `analyticsAccountId` to provision a new Google Analytics property within the specified account and associate the new property with the `FirebaseProject`. - Specify an existing `analyticsPropertyId` to associate the property with the `FirebaseProject`.

Then, as applicable, the data streams and apps are linked. Note that this auto-linking only applies to `AndroidApps` and `IosApps`. 2. If no corresponding data streams are found for the Firebase Apps, new data streams are provisioned in the Google Analytics property for each of the Firebase Apps.
