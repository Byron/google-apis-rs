By default all output is printed to standard out, but flags can be set to direct it into a file independent of your shell's capabilities. Errors will be printed to standard error, and cause the program's exit code to be non-zero. If data-structures are requested, these will be returned as pretty-printed JSON, to be useful as input to other tools. Everything else about the Comment Analyzer API can be found at the official documentation site . Installation and Source Code Install the command-line interface with cargo using: cargo install google-commentanalyzer1_alpha1-cli Find the source code on github . Usage This documentation was generated from the Comment Analyzer API at revision 20200405 . The CLI is at version 5.0.4 . commentanalyzer1-alpha1 [options] comments analyze (-r <kv>)... [-p <v>]... [-o <out>] suggestscore (-r <kv>)... [-p <v>]... [-o <out>] commentanalyzer1-alpha1 --help Configuration: [--scope <url>]... Specify the authentication a method should be executed in. Each scope requires the user to grant this application permission to use it. If unset, it defaults to the shortest scope url for a particular method. --config-dir <folder> A directory into which we will store our persistent data. Defaults to a user-writable directory that we will create during the first invocation. [default: ~/.google-service-cli] Configuration The program will store all persistent data in the ~/.google-service-cli directory in JSON files prefixed with commentanalyzer1-alpha1- . You can change the directory used to store configuration with the --config-dir flag on a per-invocation basis. More information about the various kinds of persistent data are given in the following paragraphs. Authentication Most APIs require a user to authenticate any request. If this is the case, the scope determines the set of permissions granted. The granularity of these is usually no more than read-only or full-access . If not set, the system will automatically select the smallest feasible scope, e.g. when invoking a method that is read-only, it will ask only for a read-only scope. You may use the --scope flag to specify a scope directly. All applicable scopes are documented in the respective method's CLI documentation. The first time a scope is used, the user is asked for permission. Follow the instructions given by the CLI to grant permissions, or to decline. If a scope was authenticated by the user, the respective information will be stored as JSON in the configuration directory, e.g. ~/.google-service-cli/commentanalyzer1-alpha1-token-<scope-hash>.json . No manual management of these tokens is necessary. To revoke granted authentication, please refer to the official documentation . Application Secrets In order to allow any application to use Google services, it will need to be registered using the Google Developer Console . APIs the application may use are then enabled for it one by one. Most APIs can be used for free and have a daily quota. To allow more comfortable usage of the CLI without forcing anyone to register an own application, the CLI comes with a default application secret that is configured accordingly. This also means that heavy usage all around the world may deplete the daily quota. You can workaround this limitation by putting your own secrets file at this location: ~/.google-service-cli/commentanalyzer1-alpha1-secret.json , assuming that the required commentanalyzer API was enabled for it. Such a secret file can be downloaded in the Google Developer Console at APIs & auth -> Credentials -> Download JSON and used as is. Learn more about how to setup Google projects and enable APIs using the official documentation . Debugging Even though the CLI does its best to provide usable error messages, sometimes it might be desirable to know what exactly led to a particular issue. This is done by allowing all client-server communication to be output to standard error as-is . The --debug flag will print errors using the Debug representation to standard error. You may consider redirecting standard error into a file for ease of use, e.g. commentanalyzer1-alpha1 --debug <resource> <method> [options] 2>debug.txt .","title":"Home"},{"location":"#installation-and-source-code","text":"Install the command-line interface with cargo using: cargo install google-commentanalyzer1_alpha1-cli Find the source code on github .","title":"Installation and Source Code"},{"location":"#usage","text":"This documentation was generated from the Comment Analyzer API at revision 20200405 .

You can set the scope for this method like this: commentanalyzer1-alpha1 --scope <scope> comments analyze ... Required Request Value The request value is a data-structure with various fields. Each field may be a simple scalar or another data-structure. In the latter case it is advised to set the field-cursor to the data-structure's field to specify values more concisely. For example, a structure like this: AnalyzeCommentRequest: client-token: string comment: text: string type: string community-id: string context: article-and-parent-comment: article: text: string type: string parent-comment: text: string type: string do-not-store: boolean languages: [string] session-id: string span-annotations: boolean can be set completely with the following arguments which are assumed to be executed in the given order. Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time. -r . client-token=et Opaque token that is echoed from the request to the response. comment text=magna UTF-8 encoded text. type=no Type of the text field. .. community-id=ipsum Optional identifier associating this AnalyzeCommentRequest with a particular client's community. Different communities may have different norms and rules. Specifying this value enables us to explore building community-specific models for clients. context.article-and-parent-comment.article text=voluptua. UTF-8 encoded text. type=at Type of the text field. ..parent-comment text=sanctus UTF-8 encoded text. type=sed Type of the text field. .... do-not-store=true Do not store the comment or context sent in this request. By default, the service may store comments/context for debugging purposes. languages=amet. The language(s) of the comment and context. If none are specified, we attempt to automatically detect the language. Specifying multiple languages means the text contains multiple lanugages. Both ISO and BCP-47 language codes are accepted. The server returns an error if no language was specified and language detection fails. The server also returns an error if the languages (either specified by the caller, or auto-detected) are not all supported by the service. - Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. * session-id=duo - Session ID. Used to join related RPCs into a single session. For example, an interactive tool that calls both the AnalyzeComment and SuggestCommentScore RPCs should set all invocations of both RPCs to the same Session ID, typically a random 64-bit integer. * span-annotations=true - An advisory parameter that will return span annotations if the model is capable of providing scores with sub-comment resolution. This will likely increase the size of the returned message. About Cursors The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. . Each additional . moves it up one additional level. E.g. ... would go three levels up. Optional Output Flags The method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default. -o out out specifies the destination to which to write the server's result to. It will be a JSON-encoded structure. The destination may be - to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes. If unset, it defaults to standard output.
