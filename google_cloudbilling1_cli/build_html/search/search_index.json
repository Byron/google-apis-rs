By default all output is printed to standard out, but flags can be set to direct it into a file independent of your shell's capabilities. Errors will be printed to standard error, and cause the program's exit code to be non-zero. If data-structures are requested, these will be returned as pretty-printed JSON, to be useful as input to other tools. Everything else about the Cloudbilling API can be found at the official documentation site . Installation and Source Code Install the command-line interface with cargo using: cargo install google-cloudbilling1-cli Find the source code on github .

Defaults to a user-writable directory that we will create during the first invocation. [default: ~/.google-service-cli] Configuration The program will store all persistent data in the ~/.google-service-cli directory in JSON files prefixed with cloudbilling1- . You can change the directory used to store configuration with the --config-dir flag on a per-invocation basis. More information about the various kinds of persistent data are given in the following paragraphs. Authentication Most APIs require a user to authenticate any request. If this is the case, the scope determines the set of permissions granted. The granularity of these is usually no more than read-only or full-access . If not set, the system will automatically select the smallest feasible scope, e.g. when invoking a method that is read-only, it will ask only for a read-only scope. You may use the --scope flag to specify a scope directly. All applicable scopes are documented in the respective method's CLI documentation. The first time a scope is used, the user is asked for permission. Follow the instructions given by the CLI to grant permissions, or to decline. If a scope was authenticated by the user, the respective information will be stored as JSON in the configuration directory, e.g. ~/.google-service-cli/cloudbilling1-token-<scope-hash>.json . No manual management of these tokens is necessary. To revoke granted authentication, please refer to the official documentation . Application Secrets In order to allow any application to use Google services, it will need to be registered using the Google Developer Console . APIs the application may use are then enabled for it one by one. Most APIs can be used for free and have a daily quota. To allow more comfortable usage of the CLI without forcing anyone to register an own application, the CLI comes with a default application secret that is configured accordingly. This also means that heavy usage all around the world may deplete the daily quota. You can workaround this limitation by putting your own secrets file at this location: ~/.google-service-cli/cloudbilling1-secret.json , assuming that the required cloudbilling API was enabled for it. Such a secret file can be downloaded in the Google Developer Console at APIs & auth -> Credentials -> Download JSON and used as is. Learn more about how to setup Google projects and enable APIs using the official documentation . Debugging Even though the CLI does its best to provide usable error messages, sometimes it might be desirable to know what exactly led to a particular issue. This is done by allowing all client-server communication to be output to standard error as-is . The --debug flag will print errors using the Debug representation to standard error. You may consider redirecting standard error into a file for ease of use, e.g. cloudbilling1 --debug <resource> <method> [options] 2>debug.txt .","title":"Home"},{"location":"#installation-and-source-code","text":"Install the command-line interface with cargo using: cargo install google-cloudbilling1-cli Find the source code on github .","title":"Installation and Source Code"},{"location":"#usage","text":"This documentation was generated from the Cloudbilling API at revision 20240214 .

Google Cloud resellers should use the Channel Services APIs, accounts.customers.create and accounts.customers.entitlements.create . When creating a subaccount, the current authenticated user must have the billing.accounts.update IAM permission on the parent account, which is typically given to billing account administrators . This method will return an error if the parent account has not been provisioned for subaccounts. Scopes You will need authorization for at least one of the following scopes to make a valid call: https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-billing https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform If unset, the scope for this method defaults to https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-billing . You can set the scope for this method like this: cloudbilling1 --scope <scope> billing-accounts create ... Required Request Value The request value is a data-structure with various fields. Each field may be a simple scalar or another data-structure. In the latter case it is advised to set the field-cursor to the data-structure's field to specify values more concisely. For example, a structure like this: BillingAccount: display-name: string master-billing-account: string name: string open: boolean parent: string can be set completely with the following arguments which are assumed to be executed in the given order. Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time. -r . display-name=et The display name given to the billing account, such as My Billing Account . This name is displayed in the Google Cloud Console. master-billing-account=magna If this account is a subaccount , then this will be the resource name of the parent billing account that it is being resold through. Otherwise this will be empty. name=no Output only. The resource name of the billing account. The resource name has the form billingAccounts/{billing_account_id} . For example, billingAccounts/012345-567890-ABCDEF would be the resource name for billing account 012345-567890-ABCDEF . open=true Output only. True if the billing account is open, and will therefore be charged for any usage on associated projects. False if the billing account is closed, and therefore projects associated with it are unable to use paid services. parent=voluptua. Output only. The billing account's parent resource identifier. Use the MoveBillingAccount method to update the account's parent resource if it is a organization. Format: - organizations/{organization_id} , for example, organizations/12345678 - billingAccounts/{billing_account_id} , for example, billingAccounts/012345-567890-ABCDEF About Cursors The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. . Each additional . moves it up one additional level. E.g. ... would go three levels up. Optional Output Flags The method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default. -o out out specifies the destination to which to write the server's result to. It will be a JSON-encoded structure. The destination may be - to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes. If unset, it defaults to standard output.

You specify the new billing account by setting the billing_account_name in the ProjectBillingInfo resource to the resource name of a billing account. Associating a project with an open billing account enables billing on the project and allows charges for resource usage. If the project already had a billing account, this method changes the billing account used for resource usage charges. Note: Incurred charges that have not yet been reported in the transaction history of the Google Cloud Console might be billed to the new billing account, even if the charge occurred before the new billing account was assigned to the project. The current authenticated user must have ownership privileges for both the project and the billing account . You can disable billing on the project by setting the billing_account_name field to empty. This action disassociates the current billing account from the project. Any billable activity of your in-use services will stop, and your application could stop functioning as expected. Any unbilled charges to date will be billed to the previously associated account. The current authenticated user must be either an owner of the project or an owner of the billing account for the project.
