By default all output is printed to standard out, but flags can be set to direct it into a file independent of your shell's capabilities. Errors will be printed to standard error, and cause the program's exit code to be non-zero. If data-structures are requested, these will be returned as pretty-printed JSON, to be useful as input to other tools. Everything else about the Logging API can be found at the official documentation site . Installation and Source Code Install the command-line interface with cargo using: cargo install google-logging2_beta1-cli Find the source code on github .

Specify the authentication a method should be executed in. Each scope requires the user to grant this application permission to use it. If unset, it defaults to the shortest scope url for a particular method. --config-dir <folder> A directory into which we will store our persistent data. Defaults to a user-writable directory that we will create during the first invocation. [default: ~/.google-service-cli] Configuration The program will store all persistent data in the ~/.google-service-cli directory in JSON files prefixed with logging2-beta1- . You can change the directory used to store configuration with the --config-dir flag on a per-invocation basis. More information about the various kinds of persistent data are given in the following paragraphs. Authentication Most APIs require a user to authenticate any request. If this is the case, the scope determines the set of permissions granted. The granularity of these is usually no more than read-only or full-access . If not set, the system will automatically select the smallest feasible scope, e.g. when invoking a method that is read-only, it will ask only for a read-only scope. You may use the --scope flag to specify a scope directly. All applicable scopes are documented in the respective method's CLI documentation. The first time a scope is used, the user is asked for permission. Follow the instructions given by the CLI to grant permissions, or to decline. If a scope was authenticated by the user, the respective information will be stored as JSON in the configuration directory, e.g. ~/.google-service-cli/logging2-beta1-token-<scope-hash>.json . No manual management of these tokens is necessary. To revoke granted authentication, please refer to the official documentation . Application Secrets In order to allow any application to use Google services, it will need to be registered using the Google Developer Console . APIs the application may use are then enabled for it one by one. Most APIs can be used for free and have a daily quota. To allow more comfortable usage of the CLI without forcing anyone to register an own application, the CLI comes with a default application secret that is configured accordingly. This also means that heavy usage all around the world may deplete the daily quota. You can workaround this limitation by putting your own secrets file at this location: ~/.google-service-cli/logging2-beta1-secret.json , assuming that the required logging API was enabled for it. Such a secret file can be downloaded in the Google Developer Console at APIs & auth -> Credentials -> Download JSON and used as is. Learn more about how to setup Google projects and enable APIs using the official documentation . Debugging Even though the CLI does its best to provide usable error messages, sometimes it might be desirable to know what exactly led to a particular issue. This is done by allowing all client-server communication to be output to standard error as-is . The --debug flag will print errors using the Debug representation to standard error. You may consider redirecting standard error into a file for ease of use, e.g. logging2-beta1 --debug <resource> <method> [options] 2>debug.txt .","title":"Home"},{"location":"#installation-and-source-code","text":"Install the command-line interface with cargo using: cargo install google-logging2_beta1-cli Find the source code on github .","title":"Installation and Source Code"},{"location":"#usage","text":"This documentation was generated from the Logging API at revision 20190325 .

You can set the scope for this method like this: logging2-beta1 --scope <scope> entries list ... Required Request Value The request value is a data-structure with various fields. Each field may be a simple scalar or another data-structure. In the latter case it is advised to set the field-cursor to the data-structure's field to specify values more concisely. For example, a structure like this: ListLogEntriesRequest: filter: string order-by: string page-size: integer page-token: string project-ids: [string] resource-names: [string] can be set completely with the following arguments which are assumed to be executed in the given order. Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time. -r . filter=et Optional. A filter that chooses which log entries to return. See Advanced Logs Filters. Only log entries that match the filter are returned. An empty filter matches all log entries in the resources listed in resource_names. Referencing a parent resource that is not listed in resource_names will cause the filter to return no results. The maximum length of the filter is 20000 characters. order-by=magna Optional. How the results should be sorted. Presently, the only permitted values are \"timestamp asc\" (default) and \"timestamp desc\". The first option returns entries in order of increasing values of LogEntry.timestamp (oldest first), and the second option returns entries in order of decreasing timestamps (newest first). Entries with equal timestamps are returned in order of their insert_id values. page-size=90 Optional. The maximum number of results to return from this request. Non-positive values are ignored. The presence of next_page_token in the response indicates that more results might be available. page-token=ipsum Optional. If present, then retrieve the next batch of results from the preceding call to this method. page_token must be the value of next_page_token from the previous response. The values of other method parameters should be identical to those in the previous call. project-ids=voluptua. Deprecated. Use resource_names instead. One or more project identifiers or project numbers from which to retrieve log entries. Example: \"my-project-1A\".

Names of one or more parent resources from which to retrieve log entries: \"projects/[PROJECT_ID]\" \"organizations/[ORGANIZATION_ID]\" \"billingAccounts/[BILLING_ACCOUNT_ID]\" \"folders/[FOLDER_ID]\" Projects listed in the project_ids field are added to this list. Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. About Cursors The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. . Each additional . moves it up one additional level. E.g. ... would go three levels up.

Required Request Value The request value is a data-structure with various fields. Each field may be a simple scalar or another data-structure. In the latter case it is advised to set the field-cursor to the data-structure's field to specify values more concisely. For example, a structure like this: LogMetric: bucket-options: explicit-buckets: bounds: [number] exponential-buckets: growth-factor: number num-finite-buckets: integer scale: number linear-buckets: num-finite-buckets: integer offset: number width: number create-time: string description: string filter: string label-extractors: { string: string } metric-descriptor: description: string display-name: string metadata: ingest-delay: string launch-stage: string sample-period: string metric-kind: string name: string type: string unit: string value-type: string name: string update-time: string value-extractor: string version: string can be set completely with the following arguments which are assumed to be executed in the given order.

The creation timestamp of the metric.This field may not be present for older metrics. description=duo Optional. A description of this metric, which is used in documentation. The maximum length of the description is 8000 characters. filter=ipsum Required. An advanced logs filter which is used to match log entries. Example: \"resource.type=gae_app AND severity>=ERROR\" The maximum length of the filter is 20000 characters. label-extractors=key=sed Optional. A map from a label key string to an extractor expression which is used to extract data from a log entry field and assign as the label value. Each label key specified in the LabelDescriptor must have an associated extractor expression in this map. The syntax of the extractor expression is the same as for the value_extractor field.The extracted value is converted to the type defined in the label descriptor. If the either the extraction or the type conversion fails, the label will have a default value. The default value for a string label is an empty string, for an integer label its 0, and for a boolean label its false.Note that there are upper bounds on the maximum number of labels and the number of active time series that are allowed in a project. the value will be associated with the given key metric-descriptor description=ut A detailed description of the metric, which can be used in documentation. display-name=gubergren A concise name for the metric, which can be displayed in user interfaces. Use sentence case without an ending period, for example \"Request count\". This field is optional but it is recommended to be set for any metrics associated with user-visible concepts, such as Quota. metadata ingest-delay=rebum. The delay of data points caused by ingestion. Data points older than this age are guaranteed to be ingested and available to be read, excluding data loss due to errors. launch-stage=est The launch stage of the metric definition. sample-period=ipsum The sampling period of metric data points. For metrics which are written periodically, consecutive data points are stored at this time interval, excluding data loss due to errors. Metrics with a higher granularity have a smaller sampling period. .. metric-kind=ipsum Whether the metric records instantaneous values, changes to a value, etc. Some combinations of metric_kind and value_type might not be supported. name=est The resource name of the metric descriptor. type=gubergren The metric type, including its DNS name prefix. The type is not URL-encoded. All user-defined metric types have the DNS name custom.googleapis.com or external.googleapis.com. Metric types should use a natural hierarchical grouping. For example: \"custom.googleapis.com/invoice/paid/amount\" \"external.googleapis.com/prometheus/up\" \"appengine.googleapis.com/http/server/response_latencies\" unit=ea The unit in which the metric value is reported. It is only applicable if the value_type is INT64, DOUBLE, or DISTRIBUTION. The supported units are a subset of The Unified Code for Units of Measure (http://unitsofmeasure.org/ucum.html) standard:Basic units (UNIT) bit bit By byte s second min minute h hour d dayPrefixes (PREFIX) k kilo (10 3) M mega (10 6) G giga (10 9) T tera (10 12) P peta (10 15) E exa (10 18) Z zetta (10 21) Y yotta (10 24) m milli (10 -3) u micro (10 -6) n nano (10 -9) p pico (10 -12) f femto (10 -15) a atto (10 -18) z zepto (10 -21) y yocto (10 -24) Ki kibi (2 10) Mi mebi (2 20) Gi gibi (2 30) Ti tebi (2 40)GrammarThe grammar also includes these connectors: / division (as an infix operator, e.g. 1/s). . multiplication (as an infix operator, e.g. GBy.d)The grammar for a unit is as follows: Expression = Component { \".\" Component } { \"/\" Component } ; Component = ( [ PREFIX ] UNIT | \"%\" ) [ Annotation ] | Annotation | \"1\" ; Annotation = \"{\" NAME \"}\" ; Notes: Annotation is just a comment if it follows a UNIT and is equivalent to 1 if it is used alone. For examples, {requests}/s == 1/s, By{transmitted}/s == By/s. NAME is a sequence of non-blank printable ASCII characters not containing '{' or '}'. 1 represents dimensionless value 1, such as in 1/s. % represents dimensionless value 1/100, and annotates values giving a percentage. * value-type=dolor - Whether the measurement is an integer, a floating-point number, etc. Some combinations of metric_kind and value_type might not be supported. .. name=lorem Required. The client-assigned metric identifier. Examples: \"error_count\", \"nginx/requests\".Metric identifiers are limited to 100 characters and can include only the following characters: A-Z, a-z, 0-9, and the special characters _-.,+!*',()%/. The forward-slash character (/) denotes a hierarchy of name pieces, and it cannot be the first character of the name.The metric identifier in this field must not be URL-encoded (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percent-encoding). However, when the metric identifier appears as the [METRIC_ID] part of a metric_name API parameter, then the metric identifier must be URL-encoded. Example: \"projects/my-project/metrics/nginx%2Frequests\". update-time=eos Output only. The last update timestamp of the metric.This field may not be present for older metrics. value-extractor=labore Optional. A value_extractor is required when using a distribution logs-based metric to extract the values to record from a log entry. Two functions are supported for value extraction: EXTRACT(field) or REGEXP_EXTRACT(field, regex). The argument are: 1. field: The name of the log entry field from which the value is to be extracted. 2. regex: A regular expression using the Google RE2 syntax (https://github.com/google/re2/wiki/Syntax) with a single capture group to extract data from the specified log entry field. The value of the field is converted to a string before applying the regex. It is an error to specify a regex that does not include exactly one capture group.The result of the extraction must be convertible to a double type, as the distribution always records double values. If either the extraction or the conversion to double fails, then those values are not recorded in the distribution.Example: REGEXP_EXTRACT(jsonPayload.request, \". quantity=(\\d+). \") version=sed Deprecated. The API version that created or updated this metric. The v2 format is used by default and cannot be changed. About Cursors The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. . Each additional . moves it up one additional level. E.g. ... would go three levels up. Optional Output Flags The method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default. -o out out specifies the destination to which to write the server's result to.

The last update timestamp of the metric.This field may not be present for older metrics. value-extractor=duo Optional. A value_extractor is required when using a distribution logs-based metric to extract the values to record from a log entry. Two functions are supported for value extraction: EXTRACT(field) or REGEXP_EXTRACT(field, regex). The argument are: 1. field: The name of the log entry field from which the value is to be extracted. 2. regex: A regular expression using the Google RE2 syntax (https://github.com/google/re2/wiki/Syntax) with a single capture group to extract data from the specified log entry field. The value of the field is converted to a string before applying the regex. It is an error to specify a regex that does not include exactly one capture group.The result of the extraction must be convertible to a double type, as the distribution always records double values. If either the extraction or the conversion to double fails, then those values are not recorded in the distribution.Example: REGEXP_EXTRACT(jsonPayload.request, \". quantity=(\\d+). \") version=vero Deprecated. The API version that created or updated this metric. The v2 format is used by default and cannot be changed. About Cursors The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. . Each additional . moves it up one additional level. E.g. ... would go three levels up.

For example, a structure like this: LogSink: create-time: string destination: string filter: string include-children: boolean name: string output-version-format: string update-time: string writer-identity: string can be set completely with the following arguments which are assumed to be executed in the given order. Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time. -r . create-time=vero Output only. The creation timestamp of the sink.This field may not be present for older sinks. destination=invidunt Required. The export destination: \"storage.googleapis.com/[GCS_BUCKET]\" \"bigquery.googleapis.com/projects/[PROJECT_ID]/datasets/[DATASET]\" \"pubsub.googleapis.com/projects/[PROJECT_ID]/topics/[TOPIC_ID]\" The sink's writer_identity, set when the sink is created, must have permission to write to the destination or else the log entries are not exported. For more information, see Exporting Logs with Sinks. filter=stet Optional. An advanced logs filter. The only exported log entries are those that are in the resource owning the sink and that match the filter. For example: logName=\"projects/[PROJECT_ID]/logs/[LOG_ID]\" AND severity>=ERROR include-children=false Optional. This field applies only to sinks owned by organizations and folders. If the field is false, the default, only the logs owned by the sink's parent resource are available for export. If the field is true, then logs from all the projects, folders, and billing accounts contained in the sink's parent resource are also available for export. Whether a particular log entry from the children is exported depends on the sink's filter expression. For example, if this field is true, then the filter resource.type=gce_instance would export all Compute Engine VM instance log entries from all projects in the sink's parent. To only export entries from certain child projects, filter on the project part of the log name: logName:(\"projects/test-project1/\" OR \"projects/test-project2/\") AND resource.type=gce_instance name=elitr Required. The client-assigned sink identifier, unique within the project. Example: \"my-syslog-errors-to-pubsub\". Sink identifiers are limited to 100 characters and can include only the following characters: upper and lower-case alphanumeric characters, underscores, hyphens, and periods. output-version-format=lorem Deprecated. The log entry format to use for this sink's exported log entries. The v2 format is used by default and cannot be changed. update-time=diam Output only. The last update timestamp of the sink.This field may not be present for older sinks. writer-identity=no Output only. An IAM identity&mdash;a service account or group&mdash;under which Logging writes the exported log entries to the sink's destination. This field is set by sinks.create and sinks.update based on the value of unique_writer_identity in those methods.Until you grant this identity write-access to the destination, log entry exports from this sink will fail. For more information, see Granting Access for a Resource. Consult the destination service's documentation to determine the appropriate IAM roles to assign to the identity. About Cursors The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. . Each additional . moves it up one additional level. E.g. ... would go three levels up. Optional Output Flags The method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default. -o out out specifies the destination to which to write the server's result to. It will be a JSON-encoded structure. The destination may be - to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes. If unset, it defaults to standard output. Optional Method Properties You may set the following properties to further configure the call. Please note that -p is followed by one or more key-value-pairs, and is called like this -p k1=v1 k2=v2 even though the listing below repeats the -p for completeness. -p unique-writer-identity=boolean Optional. Determines the kind of IAM identity returned as writer_identity in the new sink. If this value is omitted or set to false, and if the sink's parent is a project, then the value returned as writer_identity is the same group or service account used by Logging before the addition of writer identities to this API. The sink's destination must be in the same project as the sink itself.If this field is set to true, or if the sink is owned by a non-project resource such as an organization, then the value of writer_identity will be a unique service account used only for exports from the new sink. For more information, see writer_identity in LogSink. Optional General Properties The following properties can configure any call, and are not specific to this method. -p $-xgafv=string V1 error format. -p access-token=string OAuth access token. -p alt=string Data format for response. -p callback=string JSONP -p fields=string Selector specifying which fields to include in a partial response. -p key=string API key.

Required. The client-assigned sink identifier, unique within the project. Example: \"my-syslog-errors-to-pubsub\". Sink identifiers are limited to 100 characters and can include only the following characters: upper and lower-case alphanumeric characters, underscores, hyphens, and periods. output-version-format=et Deprecated. The log entry format to use for this sink's exported log entries. The v2 format is used by default and cannot be changed. update-time=erat Output only. The last update timestamp of the sink.This field may not be present for older sinks. writer-identity=consetetur Output only. An IAM identity&mdash;a service account or group&mdash;under which Logging writes the exported log entries to the sink's destination. This field is set by sinks.create and sinks.update based on the value of unique_writer_identity in those methods.Until you grant this identity write-access to the destination, log entry exports from this sink will fail. For more information, see Granting Access for a Resource. Consult the destination service's documentation to determine the appropriate IAM roles to assign to the identity. About Cursors The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. . Each additional . moves it up one additional level. E.g. ... would go three levels up. Optional Output Flags The method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default. -o out out specifies the destination to which to write the server's result to. It will be a JSON-encoded structure. The destination may be - to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes. If unset, it defaults to standard output. Optional Method Properties You may set the following properties to further configure the call. Please note that -p is followed by one or more key-value-pairs, and is called like this -p k1=v1 k2=v2 even though the listing below repeats the -p for completeness. -p unique-writer-identity=boolean Optional. See sinks.create for a description of this field. When updating a sink, the effect of this field on the value of writer_identity in the updated sink depends on both the old and new values of this field: If the old and new values of this field are both false or both true, then there is no change to the sink's writer_identity. If the old value is false and the new value is true, then writer_identity is changed to a unique service account. It is an error if the old value is true and the new value is set to false or defaulted to false. -p update-mask=string Optional. Field mask that specifies the fields in sink that need an update. A sink field will be overwritten if, and only if, it is in the update mask. name and output only fields cannot be updated.An empty updateMask is temporarily treated as using the following mask for backwards compatibility purposes: destination,filter,includeChildren At some point in the future, behavior will be removed and specifying an empty updateMask will be an error.For a detailed FieldMask definition, see https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/google.protobuf#google.protobuf.FieldMaskExample: updateMask=filter. Optional General Properties The following properties can configure any call, and are not specific to this method. -p $-xgafv=string V1 error format. -p access-token=string OAuth access token. -p alt=string Data format for response. -p callback=string JSONP -p fields=string Selector specifying which fields to include in a partial response. -p key=string API key.
