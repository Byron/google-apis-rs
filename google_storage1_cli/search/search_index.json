By default all output is printed to standard out, but flags can be set to direct it into a file independent of your shell's capabilities. Errors will be printed to standard error, and cause the program's exit code to be non-zero. If data-structures are requested, these will be returned as pretty-printed JSON, to be useful as input to other tools. Everything else about the storage API can be found at the official documentation site . Installation and Source Code Install the command-line interface with cargo using: cargo install google-storage1-cli Find the source code on github .

Specify the authentication a method should be executed in. Each scope requires the user to grant this application permission to use it. If unset, it defaults to the shortest scope url for a particular method. --config-dir <folder> A directory into which we will store our persistent data. Defaults to a user-writable directory that we will create during the first invocation. [default: ~/.google-service-cli] Configuration The program will store all persistent data in the ~/.google-service-cli directory in JSON files prefixed with storage1- . You can change the directory used to store configuration with the --config-dir flag on a per-invocation basis. More information about the various kinds of persistent data are given in the following paragraphs. Authentication Most APIs require a user to authenticate any request. If this is the case, the scope determines the set of permissions granted. The granularity of these is usually no more than read-only or full-access . If not set, the system will automatically select the smallest feasible scope, e.g. when invoking a method that is read-only, it will ask only for a read-only scope. You may use the --scope flag to specify a scope directly. All applicable scopes are documented in the respective method's CLI documentation. The first time a scope is used, the user is asked for permission. Follow the instructions given by the CLI to grant permissions, or to decline. If a scope was authenticated by the user, the respective information will be stored as JSON in the configuration directory, e.g. ~/.google-service-cli/storage1-token-<scope-hash>.json . No manual management of these tokens is necessary. To revoke granted authentication, please refer to the official documentation . Application Secrets In order to allow any application to use Google services, it will need to be registered using the Google Developer Console . APIs the application may use are then enabled for it one by one. Most APIs can be used for free and have a daily quota. To allow more comfortable usage of the CLI without forcing anyone to register an own application, the CLI comes with a default application secret that is configured accordingly. This also means that heavy usage all around the world may deplete the daily quota. You can workaround this limitation by putting your own secrets file at this location: ~/.google-service-cli/storage1-secret.json , assuming that the required storage API was enabled for it. Such a secret file can be downloaded in the Google Developer Console at APIs & auth -> Credentials -> Download JSON and used as is. Learn more about how to setup Google projects and enable APIs using the official documentation . Debugging Even though the CLI does its best to provide usable error messages, sometimes it might be desirable to know what exactly led to a particular issue. This is done by allowing all client-server communication to be output to standard error as-is . The --debug flag will print errors using the Debug representation to standard error. You may consider redirecting standard error into a file for ease of use, e.g. storage1 --debug <resource> <method> [options] 2>debug.txt .","title":"Home"},{"location":"#installation-and-source-code","text":"Install the command-line interface with cargo using: cargo install google-storage1-cli Find the source code on github .","title":"Installation and Source Code"},{"location":"#usage","text":"This documentation was generated from the storage API at revision 20240229 .

Required Request Value The request value is a data-structure with various fields. Each field may be a simple scalar or another data-structure. In the latter case it is advised to set the field-cursor to the data-structure's field to specify values more concisely. For example, a structure like this: AnywhereCache: admission-policy: string anywhere-cache-id: string bucket: string create-time: string id: string kind: string pending-update: boolean self-link: string state: string ttl: string update-time: string zone: string can be set completely with the following arguments which are assumed to be executed in the given order. Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time. -r . admission-policy=et The cache-level entry admission policy. anywhere-cache-id=magna The ID of the Anywhere cache instance. bucket=no The name of the bucket containing this cache instance. create-time=ipsum The creation time of the cache instance in RFC 3339 format. id=voluptua. The ID of the resource, including the project number, bucket name and anywhere cache ID. kind=at The kind of item this is. For Anywhere Cache, this is always storage#anywhereCache. pending-update=false True if the cache instance has an active Update long-running operation. self-link=amet. The link to this cache instance. state=takimata The current state of the cache instance. ttl=amet. The TTL of all cache entries in whole seconds. e.g., \"7200s\". update-time=duo The modification time of the cache instance metadata in RFC 3339 format. zone=ipsum The zone in which the cache instance is running. For example, us-central1-a. About Cursors The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. . Each additional . moves it up one additional level. E.g. ... would go three levels up.

Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. .. default-event-based-hold=false The default value for event-based hold on newly created objects in this bucket. Event-based hold is a way to retain objects indefinitely until an event occurs, signified by the hold's release. After being released, such objects will be subject to bucket-level retention (if any). One sample use case of this flag is for banks to hold loan documents for at least 3 years after loan is paid in full. Here, bucket-level retention is 3 years and the event is loan being paid in full. In this example, these objects will be held intact for any number of years until the event has occurred (event-based hold on the object is released) and then 3 more years after that. That means retention duration of the objects begins from the moment event-based hold transitioned from true to false. Objects under event-based hold cannot be deleted, overwritten or archived until the hold is removed. encryption default-kms-key-name=stet A Cloud KMS key that will be used to encrypt objects inserted into this bucket, if no encryption method is specified. .. etag=vero HTTP 1.1 Entity tag for the bucket. hierarchical-namespace enabled=true When set to true, hierarchical namespace is enabled for this bucket. ..iam-configuration.bucket-policy-only enabled=true If set, access is controlled only by bucket-level or above IAM policies. locked-time=ipsum The deadline for changing iamConfiguration.bucketPolicyOnly.enabled from true to false in RFC 3339 format. iamConfiguration.bucketPolicyOnly.enabled may be changed from true to false until the locked time, after which the field is immutable. .. public-access-prevention=accusam The bucket's Public Access Prevention configuration. Currently, 'inherited' and 'enforced' are supported. uniform-bucket-level-access enabled=true If set, access is controlled only by bucket-level or above IAM policies. locked-time=consetetur The deadline for changing iamConfiguration.uniformBucketLevelAccess.enabled from true to false in RFC 3339 format. iamConfiguration.uniformBucketLevelAccess.enabled may be changed from true to false until the locked time, after which the field is immutable. ... id=voluptua.

This value is in RFC 3339 format. is-locked=false Once locked, an object retention policy cannot be modified. retention-period=amet. The duration in seconds that objects need to be retained. Retention duration must be greater than zero and less than 100 years. Note that enforcement of retention periods less than a day is not guaranteed. Such periods should only be used for testing purposes. .. rpo=ea The Recovery Point Objective (RPO) of this bucket. Set to ASYNC_TURBO to turn on Turbo Replication on a bucket. satisfies-pzs=false Reserved for future use. self-link=lorem The URI of this bucket. soft-delete-policy effective-time=invidunt Server-determined value that indicates the time from which the policy, or one with a greater retention, was effective. This value is in RFC 3339 format. retention-duration-seconds=no The duration in seconds that soft-deleted objects in the bucket will be retained and cannot be permanently deleted. .. storage-class=est The bucket's default storage class, used whenever no storageClass is specified for a newly-created object. This defines how objects in the bucket are stored and determines the SLA and the cost of storage. Values include MULTI_REGIONAL, REGIONAL, STANDARD, NEARLINE, COLDLINE, ARCHIVE, and DURABLE_REDUCED_AVAILABILITY. If this value is not specified when the bucket is created, it will default to STANDARD. For more information, see storage classes. time-created=at The creation time of the bucket in RFC 3339 format. updated=sed The modification time of the bucket in RFC 3339 format. versioning enabled=false While set to true, versioning is fully enabled for this bucket. ..website main-page-suffix=et If the requested object path is missing, the service will ensure the path has a trailing '/', append this suffix, and attempt to retrieve the resulting object. This allows the creation of index.html objects to represent directory pages. not-found-page=tempor If the requested object path is missing, and any mainPageSuffix object is missing, if applicable, the service will return the named object from this bucket as the content for a 404 Not Found result. About Cursors The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. . Each additional . moves it up one additional level. E.g. ... would go three levels up.

That means retention duration of the objects begins from the moment event-based hold transitioned from true to false. Objects under event-based hold cannot be deleted, overwritten or archived until the hold is removed. encryption default-kms-key-name=stet A Cloud KMS key that will be used to encrypt objects inserted into this bucket, if no encryption method is specified. .. etag=vero HTTP 1.1 Entity tag for the bucket. hierarchical-namespace enabled=true When set to true, hierarchical namespace is enabled for this bucket. ..iam-configuration.bucket-policy-only enabled=true If set, access is controlled only by bucket-level or above IAM policies. locked-time=ipsum The deadline for changing iamConfiguration.bucketPolicyOnly.enabled from true to false in RFC 3339 format. iamConfiguration.bucketPolicyOnly.enabled may be changed from true to false until the locked time, after which the field is immutable. .. public-access-prevention=accusam The bucket's Public Access Prevention configuration.

This defines how objects in the bucket are stored and determines the SLA and the cost of storage. Values include MULTI_REGIONAL, REGIONAL, STANDARD, NEARLINE, COLDLINE, ARCHIVE, and DURABLE_REDUCED_AVAILABILITY. If this value is not specified when the bucket is created, it will default to STANDARD. For more information, see storage classes. time-created=at The creation time of the bucket in RFC 3339 format. updated=sed The modification time of the bucket in RFC 3339 format. versioning enabled=false While set to true, versioning is fully enabled for this bucket. ..website main-page-suffix=et If the requested object path is missing, the service will ensure the path has a trailing '/', append this suffix, and attempt to retrieve the resulting object. This allows the creation of index.html objects to represent directory pages. not-found-page=tempor If the requested object path is missing, and any mainPageSuffix object is missing, if applicable, the service will return the named object from this bucket as the content for a 404 Not Found result.","title":"Required Request Value"},{"location":"buckets_insert/#about-cursors","text":"The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures.

Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time. -r .autoclass enabled=true Whether or not Autoclass is enabled on this bucket terminal-storage-class=est The storage class that objects in the bucket eventually transition to if they are not read for a certain length of time. Valid values are NEARLINE and ARCHIVE. terminal-storage-class-update-time=sed A date and time in RFC 3339 format representing the time of the most recent update to \"terminalStorageClass\". toggle-time=diam A date and time in RFC 3339 format representing the instant at which \"enabled\" was last toggled. ..billing requester-pays=true When set to true, Requester Pays is enabled for this bucket. ..custom-placement-config data-locations=et The list of regional locations in which data is placed. Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. .. default-event-based-hold=false The default value for event-based hold on newly created objects in this bucket. Event-based hold is a way to retain objects indefinitely until an event occurs, signified by the hold's release. After being released, such objects will be subject to bucket-level retention (if any). One sample use case of this flag is for banks to hold loan documents for at least 3 years after loan is paid in full. Here, bucket-level retention is 3 years and the event is loan being paid in full. In this example, these objects will be held intact for any number of years until the event has occurred (event-based hold on the object is released) and then 3 more years after that. That means retention duration of the objects begins from the moment event-based hold transitioned from true to false. Objects under event-based hold cannot be deleted, overwritten or archived until the hold is removed. encryption default-kms-key-name=no A Cloud KMS key that will be used to encrypt objects inserted into this bucket, if no encryption method is specified. .. etag=et HTTP 1.1 Entity tag for the bucket. hierarchical-namespace enabled=false When set to true, hierarchical namespace is enabled for this bucket. ..iam-configuration.bucket-policy-only enabled=false If set, access is controlled only by bucket-level or above IAM policies. locked-time=no The deadline for changing iamConfiguration.bucketPolicyOnly.enabled from true to false in RFC 3339 format. iamConfiguration.bucketPolicyOnly.enabled may be changed from true to false until the locked time, after which the field is immutable. .. public-access-prevention=nonumy The bucket's Public Access Prevention configuration. Currently, 'inherited' and 'enforced' are supported. uniform-bucket-level-access enabled=false If set, access is controlled only by bucket-level or above IAM policies. locked-time=sadipscing The deadline for changing iamConfiguration.uniformBucketLevelAccess.enabled from true to false in RFC 3339 format. iamConfiguration.uniformBucketLevelAccess.enabled may be changed from true to false until the locked time, after which the field is immutable. ... id=aliquyam The ID of the bucket.

For buckets, this is always storage#bucket. labels=key=sadipscing User-provided labels, in key/value pairs. the value will be associated with the given key location=erat The location of the bucket. Object data for objects in the bucket resides in physical storage within this region. Defaults to US.

Can be Enabled. ..owner entity=consetetur The entity, in the form project-owner-projectId. entity-id=stet The ID for the entity. .. project-number=est The project number of the project the bucket belongs to. retention-policy effective-time=aliquyam Server-determined value that indicates the time from which policy was enforced and effective. This value is in RFC 3339 format. is-locked=false Once locked, an object retention policy cannot be modified. retention-period=duo The duration in seconds that objects need to be retained. Retention duration must be greater than zero and less than 100 years. Note that enforcement of retention periods less than a day is not guaranteed. Such periods should only be used for testing purposes. .. rpo=diam The Recovery Point Objective (RPO) of this bucket. Set to ASYNC_TURBO to turn on Turbo Replication on a bucket. satisfies-pzs=true Reserved for future use. self-link=sit The URI of this bucket. soft-delete-policy effective-time=sed Server-determined value that indicates the time from which the policy, or one with a greater retention, was effective. This value is in RFC 3339 format. retention-duration-seconds=eos The duration in seconds that soft-deleted objects in the bucket will be retained and cannot be permanently deleted. .. storage-class=lorem The bucket's default storage class, used whenever no storageClass is specified for a newly-created object. This defines how objects in the bucket are stored and determines the SLA and the cost of storage. Values include MULTI_REGIONAL, REGIONAL, STANDARD, NEARLINE, COLDLINE, ARCHIVE, and DURABLE_REDUCED_AVAILABILITY. If this value is not specified when the bucket is created, it will default to STANDARD. For more information, see storage classes. time-created=ea The creation time of the bucket in RFC 3339 format. updated=stet The modification time of the bucket in RFC 3339 format. versioning enabled=true While set to true, versioning is fully enabled for this bucket. ..website main-page-suffix=sea If the requested object path is missing, the service will ensure the path has a trailing '/', append this suffix, and attempt to retrieve the resulting object. This allows the creation of index.html objects to represent directory pages. not-found-page=et If the requested object path is missing, and any mainPageSuffix object is missing, if applicable, the service will return the named object from this bucket as the content for a 404 Not Found result. About Cursors The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. . Each additional . moves it up one additional level. E.g. ... would go three levels up. Optional Output Flags The method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default. -o out out specifies the destination to which to write the server's result to. It will be a JSON-encoded structure. The destination may be - to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes. If unset, it defaults to standard output. Optional Method Properties You may set the following properties to further configure the call. Please note that -p is followed by one or more key-value-pairs, and is called like this -p k1=v1 k2=v2 even though the listing below repeats the -p for completeness. -p if-metageneration-match=string Makes the return of the bucket metadata conditional on whether the bucket's current metageneration matches the given value. -p if-metageneration-not-match=string Makes the return of the bucket metadata conditional on whether the bucket's current metageneration does not match the given value. -p predefined-acl=string Apply a predefined set of access controls to this bucket. -p predefined-default-object-acl=string Apply a predefined set of default object access controls to this bucket. -p projection=string Set of properties to return.

Required Request Value The request value is a data-structure with various fields. Each field may be a simple scalar or another data-structure. In the latter case it is advised to set the field-cursor to the data-structure's field to specify values more concisely. For example, a structure like this: Bucket: autoclass: enabled: boolean terminal-storage-class: string terminal-storage-class-update-time: string toggle-time: string billing: requester-pays: boolean custom-placement-config: data-locations: [string] default-event-based-hold: boolean encryption: default-kms-key-name: string etag: string hierarchical-namespace: enabled: boolean iam-configuration: bucket-policy-only: enabled: boolean locked-time: string public-access-prevention: string uniform-bucket-level-access: enabled: boolean locked-time: string id: string kind: string labels: { string: string } location: string location-type: string logging: log-bucket: string log-object-prefix: string metageneration: string name: string object-retention: mode: string owner: entity: string entity-id: string project-number: string retention-policy: effective-time: string is-locked: boolean retention-period: string rpo: string satisfies-pzs: boolean self-link: string soft-delete-policy: effective-time: string retention-duration-seconds: string storage-class: string time-created: string updated: string versioning: enabled: boolean website: main-page-suffix: string not-found-page: string can be set completely with the following arguments which are assumed to be executed in the given order. Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time. -r .autoclass enabled=true Whether or not Autoclass is enabled on this bucket terminal-storage-class=erat The storage class that objects in the bucket eventually transition to if they are not read for a certain length of time. Valid values are NEARLINE and ARCHIVE. terminal-storage-class-update-time=dolores A date and time in RFC 3339 format representing the time of the most recent update to \"terminalStorageClass\". toggle-time=erat A date and time in RFC 3339 format representing the instant at which \"enabled\" was last toggled. ..billing requester-pays=false When set to true, Requester Pays is enabled for this bucket. ..custom-placement-config data-locations=sea The list of regional locations in which data is placed. Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. .. default-event-based-hold=true The default value for event-based hold on newly created objects in this bucket. Event-based hold is a way to retain objects indefinitely until an event occurs, signified by the hold's release. After being released, such objects will be subject to bucket-level retention (if any). One sample use case of this flag is for banks to hold loan documents for at least 3 years after loan is paid in full. Here, bucket-level retention is 3 years and the event is loan being paid in full. In this example, these objects will be held intact for any number of years until the event has occurred (event-based hold on the object is released) and then 3 more years after that. That means retention duration of the objects begins from the moment event-based hold transitioned from true to false. Objects under event-based hold cannot be deleted, overwritten or archived until the hold is removed. encryption default-kms-key-name=lorem A Cloud KMS key that will be used to encrypt objects inserted into this bucket, if no encryption method is specified. .. etag=et HTTP 1.1 Entity tag for the bucket. hierarchical-namespace enabled=false When set to true, hierarchical namespace is enabled for this bucket. ..iam-configuration.bucket-policy-only enabled=true If set, access is controlled only by bucket-level or above IAM policies. locked-time=erat The deadline for changing iamConfiguration.bucketPolicyOnly.enabled from true to false in RFC 3339 format. iamConfiguration.bucketPolicyOnly.enabled may be changed from true to false until the locked time, after which the field is immutable. .. public-access-prevention=sea The bucket's Public Access Prevention configuration.

Set to ASYNC_TURBO to turn on Turbo Replication on a bucket. satisfies-pzs=true Reserved for future use. self-link=sadipscing The URI of this bucket. soft-delete-policy effective-time=at Server-determined value that indicates the time from which the policy, or one with a greater retention, was effective. This value is in RFC 3339 format. retention-duration-seconds=sit The duration in seconds that soft-deleted objects in the bucket will be retained and cannot be permanently deleted. .. storage-class=duo The bucket's default storage class, used whenever no storageClass is specified for a newly-created object. This defines how objects in the bucket are stored and determines the SLA and the cost of storage. Values include MULTI_REGIONAL, REGIONAL, STANDARD, NEARLINE, COLDLINE, ARCHIVE, and DURABLE_REDUCED_AVAILABILITY. If this value is not specified when the bucket is created, it will default to STANDARD. For more information, see storage classes. time-created=sit The creation time of the bucket in RFC 3339 format. updated=magna The modification time of the bucket in RFC 3339 format. versioning enabled=true While set to true, versioning is fully enabled for this bucket. ..website main-page-suffix=dolor If the requested object path is missing, the service will ensure the path has a trailing '/', append this suffix, and attempt to retrieve the resulting object. This allows the creation of index.html objects to represent directory pages. not-found-page=lorem If the requested object path is missing, and any mainPageSuffix object is missing, if applicable, the service will return the named object from this bucket as the content for a 404 Not Found result. About Cursors The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. . Each additional . moves it up one additional level. E.g. ... would go three levels up. Optional Output Flags The method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default. -o out out specifies the destination to which to write the server's result to. It will be a JSON-encoded structure. The destination may be - to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes. If unset, it defaults to standard output.

Each field may be a simple scalar or another data-structure. In the latter case it is advised to set the field-cursor to the data-structure's field to specify values more concisely. For example, a structure like this: ObjectAccessControl: bucket: string domain: string email: string entity: string entity-id: string etag: string generation: string id: string kind: string object: string project-team: project-number: string team: string role: string self-link: string can be set completely with the following arguments which are assumed to be executed in the given order. Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time. -r . bucket=invidunt The name of the bucket. domain=nonumy The domain associated with the entity, if any. email=erat The email address associated with the entity, if any. entity=erat The entity holding the permission, in one of the following forms: user-userId user-email group-groupId group-email domain-domain project-team-projectId allUsers allAuthenticatedUsers Examples: The user liz@example.com would be user-liz@example.com.

About Cursors The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. . Each additional . moves it up one additional level. E.g. ... would go three levels up. Optional Output Flags The method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default. -o out out specifies the destination to which to write the server's result to.

One sample use case of this flag is for banks to hold loan documents for at least 3 years after loan is paid in full. Here, bucket-level retention is 3 years and the event is the loan being paid in full. In this example, these objects will be held intact for any number of years until the event has occurred (event-based hold on the object is released) and then 3 more years after that. That means retention duration of the objects begins from the moment event-based hold transitioned from true to false. generation=sit The content generation of this object. Used for object versioning. hard-delete-time=kasd This is the time (in the future) when the soft-deleted object will no longer be restorable. It is equal to the soft delete time plus the current soft delete retention duration of the bucket. id=tempor The ID of the object, including the bucket name, object name, and generation number. kind=dolor The kind of item this is.

About Cursors The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. . Each additional . moves it up one additional level. E.g. ... would go three levels up. Optional Output Flags The method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default. -o out out specifies the destination to which to write the server's result to. It will be a JSON-encoded structure. The destination may be - to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes. If unset, it defaults to standard output.

For more information about using the CRC32c checksum, see Hashes and ETags: Best Practices. custom-time=duo A timestamp in RFC 3339 format specified by the user for an object. customer-encryption encryption-algorithm=et The encryption algorithm. key-sha256=erat SHA256 hash value of the encryption key. .. etag=sit HTTP 1.1 Entity tag for the object. event-based-hold=false Whether an object is under event-based hold. Event-based hold is a way to retain objects until an event occurs, which is signified by the hold's release (i.e. this value is set to false). After being released (set to false), such objects will be subject to bucket-level retention (if any). One sample use case of this flag is for banks to hold loan documents for at least 3 years after loan is paid in full. Here, bucket-level retention is 3 years and the event is the loan being paid in full. In this example, these objects will be held intact for any number of years until the event has occurred (event-based hold on the object is released) and then 3 more years after that. That means retention duration of the objects begins from the moment event-based hold transitioned from true to false. generation=et The content generation of this object. Used for object versioning. hard-delete-time=nonumy This is the time (in the future) when the soft-deleted object will no longer be restorable. It is equal to the soft delete time plus the current soft delete retention duration of the bucket. id=accusam The ID of the object, including the bucket name, object name, and generation number. kind=ut The kind of item this is. For objects, this is always storage#object. kms-key-name=voluptua. Not currently supported. Specifying the parameter causes the request to fail with status code 400 - Bad Request. md5-hash=consetetur MD5 hash of the data; encoded using base64. For more information about using the MD5 hash, see Hashes and ETags: Best Practices. media-link=dolor Media download link. metadata=key=amet User-provided metadata, in key/value pairs. the value will be associated with the given key metageneration=et The version of the metadata for this object at this generation. Used for preconditions and for detecting changes in metadata. A metageneration number is only meaningful in the context of a particular generation of a particular object. name=aliquyam The name of the object. Required if not specified by URL parameter. owner entity=ipsum The entity, in the form user-userId. entity-id=gubergren The ID for the entity. ..retention mode=invidunt The bucket's object retention mode, can only be Unlocked or Locked. retain-until-time=sea A time in RFC 3339 format until which object retention protects this object. .. retention-expiration-time=duo A server-determined value that specifies the earliest time that the object's retention period expires. This value is in RFC 3339 format. Note 1: This field is not provided for objects with an active event-based hold, since retention expiration is unknown until the hold is removed. Note 2: This value can be provided even when temporary hold is set (so that the user can reason about policy without having to first unset the temporary hold). self-link=sea The link to this object. size=stet Content-Length of the data in bytes. soft-delete-time=sadipscing The time at which the object became soft-deleted in RFC 3339 format. storage-class=no Storage class of the object. temporary-hold=true Whether an object is under temporary hold. While this flag is set to true, the object is protected against deletion and overwrites. A common use case of this flag is regulatory investigations where objects need to be retained while the investigation is ongoing. Note that unlike event-based hold, temporary hold does not impact retention expiration time of an object. time-created=ipsum The creation time of the object in RFC 3339 format. time-deleted=sea The time at which the object became noncurrent in RFC 3339 format. Will be returned if and only if this version of the object has been deleted. time-storage-class-updated=sit The time at which the object's storage class was last changed. When the object is initially created, it will be set to timeCreated. updated=amet. The modification time of the object metadata in RFC 3339 format. Set initially to object creation time and then updated whenever any metadata of the object changes. This includes changes made by a requester, such as modifying custom metadata, as well as changes made by Cloud Storage on behalf of a requester, such as changing the storage class based on an Object Lifecycle Configuration.","title":"Required Request Value"},{"location":"objects_copy/#about-cursors","text":"The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures.

Required if not specified by URL parameter. owner entity=nonumy The entity, in the form user-userId. entity-id=sea The ID for the entity. ..retention mode=eos The bucket's object retention mode, can only be Unlocked or Locked. retain-until-time=dolore A time in RFC 3339 format until which object retention protects this object. .. retention-expiration-time=accusam A server-determined value that specifies the earliest time that the object's retention period expires. This value is in RFC 3339 format. Note 1: This field is not provided for objects with an active event-based hold, since retention expiration is unknown until the hold is removed. Note 2: This value can be provided even when temporary hold is set (so that the user can reason about policy without having to first unset the temporary hold). self-link=elitr The link to this object. size=sed Content-Length of the data in bytes. soft-delete-time=labore The time at which the object became soft-deleted in RFC 3339 format. storage-class=et Storage class of the object. temporary-hold=false Whether an object is under temporary hold. While this flag is set to true, the object is protected against deletion and overwrites. A common use case of this flag is regulatory investigations where objects need to be retained while the investigation is ongoing. Note that unlike event-based hold, temporary hold does not impact retention expiration time of an object. time-created=sed The creation time of the object in RFC 3339 format. time-deleted=at The time at which the object became noncurrent in RFC 3339 format. Will be returned if and only if this version of the object has been deleted. time-storage-class-updated=stet The time at which the object's storage class was last changed. When the object is initially created, it will be set to timeCreated. updated=sit The modification time of the object metadata in RFC 3339 format. Set initially to object creation time and then updated whenever any metadata of the object changes. This includes changes made by a requester, such as modifying custom metadata, as well as changes made by Cloud Storage on behalf of a requester, such as changing the storage class based on an Object Lifecycle Configuration. About Cursors The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. . Each additional . moves it up one additional level. E.g. ... would go three levels up. Required Upload Flags This method supports the upload of data, which requires all of the following flags to be set: -u simple simple - Upload media all at once. -f file Path to file to upload. It must be seekable. The following flag may be set: -m mime the mime type, like 'application/octet-stream', which is the default Optional Output Flags The method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default. -o out out specifies the destination to which to write the server's result to. It will be a JSON-encoded structure. The destination may be - to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes. If unset, it defaults to standard output. Optional Method Properties You may set the following properties to further configure the call. Please note that -p is followed by one or more key-value-pairs, and is called like this -p k1=v1 k2=v2 even though the listing below repeats the -p for completeness. -p content-encoding=string If set, sets the contentEncoding property of the final object to this value. Setting this parameter is equivalent to setting the contentEncoding metadata property. This can be useful when uploading an object with uploadType=media to indicate the encoding of the content being uploaded. -p if-generation-match=string Makes the operation conditional on whether the object's current generation matches the given value. Setting to 0 makes the operation succeed only if there are no live versions of the object. -p if-generation-not-match=string Makes the operation conditional on whether the object's current generation does not match the given value. If no live object exists, the precondition fails. Setting to 0 makes the operation succeed only if there is a live version of the object. -p if-metageneration-match=string Makes the operation conditional on whether the object's current metageneration matches the given value. -p if-metageneration-not-match=string Makes the operation conditional on whether the object's current metageneration does not match the given value. -p kms-key-name=string Resource name of the Cloud KMS key, of the form projects/my-project/locations/global/keyRings/my-kr/cryptoKeys/my-key, that will be used to encrypt the object. Overrides the object metadata's kms_key_name value, if any. -p name=string Name of the object. Required when the object metadata is not otherwise provided. Overrides the object metadata's name value, if any. For information about how to URL encode object names to be path safe, see Encoding URI Path Parts . -p predefined-acl=string Apply a predefined set of access controls to this object. -p projection=string Set of properties to return. Defaults to noAcl, unless the object resource specifies the acl property, when it defaults to full. -p user-project=string The project to be billed for this request. Required for Requester Pays buckets. Optional General Properties The following properties can configure any call, and are not specific to this method. -p alt=string Data format for the response. -p fields=string Selector specifying which fields to include in a partial response. -p key=string API key. Your API key identifies your project and provides you with API access, quota, and reports. Required unless you provide an OAuth 2.0 token. -p oauth-token=string OAuth 2.0 token for the current user. -p pretty-print=boolean Returns response with indentations and line breaks. -p quota-user=string An opaque string that represents a user for quota purposes. Must not exceed 40 characters. -p upload-type=string Upload protocol for media (e.g. \"media\", \"multipart\", \"resumable\"). -p user-ip=string Deprecated.

Note that unlike event-based hold, temporary hold does not impact retention expiration time of an object. time-created=sanctus The creation time of the object in RFC 3339 format. time-deleted=invidunt The time at which the object became noncurrent in RFC 3339 format. Will be returned if and only if this version of the object has been deleted. time-storage-class-updated=dolor The time at which the object's storage class was last changed. When the object is initially created, it will be set to timeCreated. updated=eos The modification time of the object metadata in RFC 3339 format. Set initially to object creation time and then updated whenever any metadata of the object changes. This includes changes made by a requester, such as modifying custom metadata, as well as changes made by Cloud Storage on behalf of a requester, such as changing the storage class based on an Object Lifecycle Configuration. About Cursors The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. . Each additional . moves it up one additional level. E.g. ... would go three levels up. Optional Output Flags The method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default. -o out out specifies the destination to which to write the server's result to. It will be a JSON-encoded structure. The destination may be - to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes. If unset, it defaults to standard output. Optional Method Properties You may set the following properties to further configure the call. Please note that -p is followed by one or more key-value-pairs, and is called like this -p k1=v1 k2=v2 even though the listing below repeats the -p for completeness. -p generation=string If present, selects a specific revision of this object (as opposed to the latest version, the default). -p if-generation-match=string Makes the operation conditional on whether the object's current generation matches the given value. Setting to 0 makes the operation succeed only if there are no live versions of the object. -p if-generation-not-match=string Makes the operation conditional on whether the object's current generation does not match the given value. If no live object exists, the precondition fails. Setting to 0 makes the operation succeed only if there is a live version of the object. -p if-metageneration-match=string Makes the operation conditional on whether the object's current metageneration matches the given value. -p if-metageneration-not-match=string Makes the operation conditional on whether the object's current metageneration does not match the given value. -p override-unlocked-retention=boolean Must be true to remove the retention configuration, reduce its unlocked retention period, or change its mode from unlocked to locked. -p predefined-acl=string Apply a predefined set of access controls to this object. -p projection=string Set of properties to return. Defaults to full. -p user-project=string The project to be billed for this request, for Requester Pays buckets. Optional General Properties The following properties can configure any call, and are not specific to this method. -p alt=string Data format for the response. -p fields=string Selector specifying which fields to include in a partial response. -p key=string API key.

Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time. -r . bucket=sed The name of the bucket containing this object. cache-control=no Cache-Control directive for the object data. If omitted, and the object is accessible to all anonymous users, the default will be public, max-age=3600. component-count=36 Number of underlying components that make up this object. Components are accumulated by compose operations. content-disposition=sea Content-Disposition of the object data. content-encoding=clita Content-Encoding of the object data. content-language=consetetur Content-Language of the object data. content-type=dolores Content-Type of the object data. If an object is stored without a Content-Type, it is served as application/octet-stream. crc32c=sit CRC32c checksum, as described in RFC 4960, Appendix B; encoded using base64 in big-endian byte order. For more information about using the CRC32c checksum, see Hashes and ETags: Best Practices. custom-time=sea A timestamp in RFC 3339 format specified by the user for an object. customer-encryption encryption-algorithm=sanctus The encryption algorithm. key-sha256=kasd SHA256 hash value of the encryption key. .. etag=eirmod HTTP 1.1 Entity tag for the object. event-based-hold=true Whether an object is under event-based hold. Event-based hold is a way to retain objects until an event occurs, which is signified by the hold's release (i.e. this value is set to false). After being released (set to false), such objects will be subject to bucket-level retention (if any). One sample use case of this flag is for banks to hold loan documents for at least 3 years after loan is paid in full. Here, bucket-level retention is 3 years and the event is the loan being paid in full. In this example, these objects will be held intact for any number of years until the event has occurred (event-based hold on the object is released) and then 3 more years after that. That means retention duration of the objects begins from the moment event-based hold transitioned from true to false. generation=magna The content generation of this object. Used for object versioning. hard-delete-time=rebum. This is the time (in the future) when the soft-deleted object will no longer be restorable. It is equal to the soft delete time plus the current soft delete retention duration of the bucket. id=amet The ID of the object, including the bucket name, object name, and generation number. kind=sea The kind of item this is. For objects, this is always storage#object. kms-key-name=sadipscing Not currently supported. Specifying the parameter causes the request to fail with status code 400 - Bad Request. md5-hash=dolore MD5 hash of the data; encoded using base64. For more information about using the MD5 hash, see Hashes and ETags: Best Practices. media-link=amet Media download link. metadata=key=invidunt User-provided metadata, in key/value pairs. the value will be associated with the given key metageneration=invidunt The version of the metadata for this object at this generation. Used for preconditions and for detecting changes in metadata. A metageneration number is only meaningful in the context of a particular generation of a particular object. name=dolores The name of the object. Required if not specified by URL parameter. owner entity=diam The entity, in the form user-userId. entity-id=sanctus The ID for the entity. ..retention mode=sed The bucket's object retention mode, can only be Unlocked or Locked. retain-until-time=eos A time in RFC 3339 format until which object retention protects this object. .. retention-expiration-time=sit A server-determined value that specifies the earliest time that the object's retention period expires. This value is in RFC 3339 format. Note 1: This field is not provided for objects with an active event-based hold, since retention expiration is unknown until the hold is removed. Note 2: This value can be provided even when temporary hold is set (so that the user can reason about policy without having to first unset the temporary hold). self-link=et The link to this object. size=ea Content-Length of the data in bytes. soft-delete-time=dolor The time at which the object became soft-deleted in RFC 3339 format. storage-class=sadipscing Storage class of the object. temporary-hold=false Whether an object is under temporary hold. While this flag is set to true, the object is protected against deletion and overwrites. A common use case of this flag is regulatory investigations where objects need to be retained while the investigation is ongoing. Note that unlike event-based hold, temporary hold does not impact retention expiration time of an object. time-created=at The creation time of the object in RFC 3339 format. time-deleted=at The time at which the object became noncurrent in RFC 3339 format. Will be returned if and only if this version of the object has been deleted. time-storage-class-updated=kasd The time at which the object's storage class was last changed. When the object is initially created, it will be set to timeCreated. updated=magna The modification time of the object metadata in RFC 3339 format. Set initially to object creation time and then updated whenever any metadata of the object changes. This includes changes made by a requester, such as modifying custom metadata, as well as changes made by Cloud Storage on behalf of a requester, such as changing the storage class based on an Object Lifecycle Configuration. About Cursors The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. . Each additional . moves it up one additional level. E.g. ... would go three levels up. Optional Output Flags The method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default. -o out out specifies the destination to which to write the server's result to. It will be a JSON-encoded structure. The destination may be - to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes. If unset, it defaults to standard output.

Most callers shouldn't need to specify this parameter - it is primarily in place to support testing. If specified the value must be an integral multiple of 1 MiB (1048576). Also, this only applies to requests where the source and destination span locations and/or storage classes.

Event-based hold is a way to retain objects until an event occurs, which is signified by the hold's release (i.e. this value is set to false). After being released (set to false), such objects will be subject to bucket-level retention (if any). One sample use case of this flag is for banks to hold loan documents for at least 3 years after loan is paid in full. Here, bucket-level retention is 3 years and the event is the loan being paid in full. In this example, these objects will be held intact for any number of years until the event has occurred (event-based hold on the object is released) and then 3 more years after that. That means retention duration of the objects begins from the moment event-based hold transitioned from true to false. generation=lorem The content generation of this object. Used for object versioning. hard-delete-time=amet. This is the time (in the future) when the soft-deleted object will no longer be restorable.

This value is in RFC 3339 format. Note 1: This field is not provided for objects with an active event-based hold, since retention expiration is unknown until the hold is removed. Note 2: This value can be provided even when temporary hold is set (so that the user can reason about policy without having to first unset the temporary hold). self-link=tempor The link to this object. size=et Content-Length of the data in bytes. soft-delete-time=voluptua. The time at which the object became soft-deleted in RFC 3339 format. storage-class=et Storage class of the object. temporary-hold=true Whether an object is under temporary hold. While this flag is set to true, the object is protected against deletion and overwrites. A common use case of this flag is regulatory investigations where objects need to be retained while the investigation is ongoing. Note that unlike event-based hold, temporary hold does not impact retention expiration time of an object. time-created=stet The creation time of the object in RFC 3339 format. time-deleted=dolor The time at which the object became noncurrent in RFC 3339 format. Will be returned if and only if this version of the object has been deleted. time-storage-class-updated=et The time at which the object's storage class was last changed. When the object is initially created, it will be set to timeCreated. updated=labore The modification time of the object metadata in RFC 3339 format. Set initially to object creation time and then updated whenever any metadata of the object changes. This includes changes made by a requester, such as modifying custom metadata, as well as changes made by Cloud Storage on behalf of a requester, such as changing the storage class based on an Object Lifecycle Configuration. About Cursors The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o .

Optional. type=dolor The type of delivery mechanism used for this channel. About Cursors The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. . Each additional . moves it up one additional level. E.g. ... would go three levels up. Optional Output Flags The method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default. -o out out specifies the destination to which to write the server's result to.

Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time. -r . access-id=amet. The ID of the HMAC Key. etag=kasd HTTP 1.1 Entity tag for the HMAC key. id=eirmod The ID of the HMAC key, including the Project ID and the Access ID. kind=amet. The kind of item this is. For HMAC Key metadata, this is always storage#hmacKeyMetadata. project-id=takimata Project ID owning the service account to which the key authenticates. self-link=amet. The link to this resource. service-account-email=et The email address of the key's associated service account. state=labore The state of the key. Can be one of ACTIVE, INACTIVE, or DELETED. time-created=sed The creation time of the HMAC key in RFC 3339 format. updated=sit The last modification time of the HMAC key metadata in RFC 3339 format. About Cursors The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. . Each additional . moves it up one additional level. E.g. ... would go three levels up. Optional Output Flags The method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default. -o out out specifies the destination to which to write the server's result to. It will be a JSON-encoded structure. The destination may be - to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes. If unset, it defaults to standard output. Optional Method Properties You may set the following properties to further configure the call. Please note that -p is followed by one or more key-value-pairs, and is called like this -p k1=v1 k2=v2 even though the listing below repeats the -p for completeness. -p user-project=string The project to be billed for this request. Optional General Properties The following properties can configure any call, and are not specific to this method. -p alt=string Data format for the response. -p fields=string Selector specifying which fields to include in a partial response. -p key=string API key. Your API key identifies your project and provides you with API access, quota, and reports. Required unless you provide an OAuth 2.0 token. -p oauth-token=string OAuth 2.0 token for the current user. -p pretty-print=boolean Returns response with indentations and line breaks. -p quota-user=string An opaque string that represents a user for quota purposes. Must not exceed 40 characters. -p upload-type=string Upload protocol for media (e.g. \"media\", \"multipart\", \"resumable\"). -p user-ip=string Deprecated.
