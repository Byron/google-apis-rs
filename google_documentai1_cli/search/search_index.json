By default all output is printed to standard out, but flags can be set to direct it into a file independent of your shell's capabilities. Errors will be printed to standard error, and cause the program's exit code to be non-zero. If data-structures are requested, these will be returned as pretty-printed JSON, to be useful as input to other tools. Everything else about the Document API can be found at the official documentation site . Installation and Source Code Install the command-line interface with cargo using: cargo install google-documentai1-cli Find the source code on github .

Each scope requires the user to grant this application permission to use it. If unset, it defaults to the shortest scope url for a particular method. --config-dir <folder> A directory into which we will store our persistent data. Defaults to a user-writable directory that we will create during the first invocation. [default: ~/.google-service-cli] Configuration The program will store all persistent data in the ~/.google-service-cli directory in JSON files prefixed with documentai1- . You can change the directory used to store configuration with the --config-dir flag on a per-invocation basis. More information about the various kinds of persistent data are given in the following paragraphs. Authentication Most APIs require a user to authenticate any request. If this is the case, the scope determines the set of permissions granted. The granularity of these is usually no more than read-only or full-access . If not set, the system will automatically select the smallest feasible scope, e.g. when invoking a method that is read-only, it will ask only for a read-only scope. You may use the --scope flag to specify a scope directly. All applicable scopes are documented in the respective method's CLI documentation. The first time a scope is used, the user is asked for permission. Follow the instructions given by the CLI to grant permissions, or to decline. If a scope was authenticated by the user, the respective information will be stored as JSON in the configuration directory, e.g. ~/.google-service-cli/documentai1-token-<scope-hash>.json . No manual management of these tokens is necessary. To revoke granted authentication, please refer to the official documentation . Application Secrets In order to allow any application to use Google services, it will need to be registered using the Google Developer Console . APIs the application may use are then enabled for it one by one. Most APIs can be used for free and have a daily quota. To allow more comfortable usage of the CLI without forcing anyone to register an own application, the CLI comes with a default application secret that is configured accordingly. This also means that heavy usage all around the world may deplete the daily quota. You can workaround this limitation by putting your own secrets file at this location: ~/.google-service-cli/documentai1-secret.json , assuming that the required documentai API was enabled for it. Such a secret file can be downloaded in the Google Developer Console at APIs & auth -> Credentials -> Download JSON and used as is. Learn more about how to setup Google projects and enable APIs using the official documentation . Debugging Even though the CLI does its best to provide usable error messages, sometimes it might be desirable to know what exactly led to a particular issue. This is done by allowing all client-server communication to be output to standard error as-is . The --debug flag will print errors using the Debug representation to standard error. You may consider redirecting standard error into a file for ease of use, e.g. documentai1 --debug <resource> <method> [options] 2>debug.txt .","title":"Home"},{"location":"#installation-and-source-code","text":"Install the command-line interface with cargo using: cargo install google-documentai1-cli Find the source code on github .","title":"Installation and Source Code"},{"location":"#usage","text":"This documentation was generated from the Document API at revision 20240223 .

The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. .

Character box detection is enabled by default in OCR 2.0 (and later) processors. enable-image-quality-scores=true Enables intelligent document quality scores after OCR. Can help with diagnosing why OCR responses are of poor quality for a given input. Adds additional latency comparable to regular OCR to the process call. enable-native-pdf-parsing=true Enables special handling for PDFs with existing text information. Results in better text extraction quality in such PDF inputs. enable-symbol=false Includes symbol level OCR information if set to true. hints language-hints=dolor List of BCP-47 language codes to use for OCR. In most cases, not specifying it yields the best results since it enables automatic language detection. For languages based on the Latin alphabet, setting hints is not needed.

The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. .

Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time. -r . field-mask=lorem Specifies which fields to include in the ProcessResponse.document output. Only supports top-level document and pages field, so it must be in the form of {document_field_name} or pages.{page_field_name} . gcs-document gcs-uri=accusam The Cloud Storage object uri. mime-type=amet An IANA MIME type (RFC6838) of the content. ..inline-document content=erat Optional. Inline document content, represented as a stream of bytes. Note: As with all bytes fields, protobuffers use a pure binary representation, whereas JSON representations use base64. error code=32 The status code, which should be an enum value of google.rpc.Code. message=erat A developer-facing error message, which should be in English. Any user-facing error message should be localized and sent in the google.rpc.Status.details field, or localized by the client. .. mime-type=accusam An IANA published media type (MIME type) . shard-info shard-count=-10 Total number of shards. shard-index=takimata The 0-based index of this shard. text-offset=lorem The index of the first character in Document.text in the overall document global text. .. text=et Optional. UTF-8 encoded text in reading order from the document. uri=at Optional. Currently supports Google Cloud Storage URI of the form gs://bucket_name/object_name . Object versioning is not supported. For more information, refer to Google Cloud Storage Request URIs . .. labels=key=dolor Optional. The labels with user-defined metadata for the request. Label keys and values can be no longer than 63 characters (Unicode codepoints) and can only contain lowercase letters, numeric characters, underscores, and dashes. International characters are allowed. Label values are optional. Label keys must start with a letter. the value will be associated with the given key process-options from-end=79 Only process certain pages from the end, same as above. from-start=53 Only process certain pages from the start. Process all if the document has fewer pages. individual-page-selector pages=20 Optional. Indices of the pages (starting from 1). Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. ..ocr-config advanced-ocr-options=sea A list of advanced OCR options to further fine-tune OCR behavior. Current valid values are: - legacy_layout : a heuristics layout detection algorithm, which serves as an alternative to the current ML-based layout detection algorithm. Customers can choose the best suitable layout algorithm based on their situation. Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. compute-style-info=true Turn on font identification model and return font style information. Deprecated, use PremiumFeatures.compute_style_info instead. disable-character-boxes-detection=true Turn off character box detector in OCR engine. Character box detection is enabled by default in OCR 2.0 (and later) processors. enable-image-quality-scores=false Enables intelligent document quality scores after OCR. Can help with diagnosing why OCR responses are of poor quality for a given input. Adds additional latency comparable to regular OCR to the process call. enable-native-pdf-parsing=false Enables special handling for PDFs with existing text information. Results in better text extraction quality in such PDF inputs. enable-symbol=false Includes symbol level OCR information if set to true. hints language-hints=dolores List of BCP-47 language codes to use for OCR. In most cases, not specifying it yields the best results since it enables automatic language detection. For languages based on the Latin alphabet, setting hints is not needed. In rare cases, when the language of the text in the image is known, setting a hint will help get better results (although it will be a significant hindrance if the hint is wrong).

Only available in OCR 2.0 (and later) processors. ...schema-override description=amet. Description of the schema. display-name=ipsum Display name to show to users. metadata document-allow-multiple-labels=true If true, on a given page, there can be multiple document annotations covering it. document-splitter=false If true, a document entity type can be applied to subdocument (splitting). Otherwise, it can only be applied to the entire document (classification). prefixed-naming-on-properties=true If set, all the nested entities must be prefixed with the parents. skip-naming-validation=true If set, we will skip the naming format validation in the schema. So the string values in DocumentSchema.EntityType.name and DocumentSchema.EntityType.Property.name will not be checked. ....raw-document content=at Inline document content. display-name=sit The display name of the document, it supports all Unicode characters except the following: * , ? , [ , ] , % , { , } , &#39; , \\&#34; , , ~ , = and : are reserved.
