By default all output is printed to standard out, but flags can be set to direct it into a file independent of your shell's capabilities. Errors will be printed to standard error, and cause the program's exit code to be non-zero. If data-structures are requested, these will be returned as pretty-printed JSON, to be useful as input to other tools. Everything else about the Access Approval API can be found at the official documentation site . Installation and Source Code Install the command-line interface with cargo using: cargo install google-accessapproval1-cli Find the source code on github .

Specify the authentication a method should be executed in. Each scope requires the user to grant this application permission to use it. If unset, it defaults to the shortest scope url for a particular method. --config-dir <folder> A directory into which we will store our persistent data. Defaults to a user-writable directory that we will create during the first invocation. [default: ~/.google-service-cli] Configuration The program will store all persistent data in the ~/.google-service-cli directory in JSON files prefixed with accessapproval1- . You can change the directory used to store configuration with the --config-dir flag on a per-invocation basis. More information about the various kinds of persistent data are given in the following paragraphs. Authentication Most APIs require a user to authenticate any request. If this is the case, the scope determines the set of permissions granted. The granularity of these is usually no more than read-only or full-access . If not set, the system will automatically select the smallest feasible scope, e.g. when invoking a method that is read-only, it will ask only for a read-only scope. You may use the --scope flag to specify a scope directly. All applicable scopes are documented in the respective method's CLI documentation. The first time a scope is used, the user is asked for permission. Follow the instructions given by the CLI to grant permissions, or to decline. If a scope was authenticated by the user, the respective information will be stored as JSON in the configuration directory, e.g. ~/.google-service-cli/accessapproval1-token-<scope-hash>.json . No manual management of these tokens is necessary. To revoke granted authentication, please refer to the official documentation . Application Secrets In order to allow any application to use Google services, it will need to be registered using the Google Developer Console . APIs the application may use are then enabled for it one by one. Most APIs can be used for free and have a daily quota. To allow more comfortable usage of the CLI without forcing anyone to register an own application, the CLI comes with a default application secret that is configured accordingly. This also means that heavy usage all around the world may deplete the daily quota. You can workaround this limitation by putting your own secrets file at this location: ~/.google-service-cli/accessapproval1-secret.json , assuming that the required accessapproval API was enabled for it. Such a secret file can be downloaded in the Google Developer Console at APIs & auth -> Credentials -> Download JSON and used as is. Learn more about how to setup Google projects and enable APIs using the official documentation . Debugging Even though the CLI does its best to provide usable error messages, sometimes it might be desirable to know what exactly led to a particular issue. This is done by allowing all client-server communication to be output to standard error as-is . The --debug flag will print errors using the Debug representation to standard error. You may consider redirecting standard error into a file for ease of use, e.g. accessapproval1 --debug <resource> <method> [options] 2>debug.txt .","title":"Home"},{"location":"#installation-and-source-code","text":"Install the command-line interface with cargo using: cargo install google-accessapproval1-cli Find the source code on github .","title":"Installation and Source Code"},{"location":"#usage","text":"This documentation was generated from the Access Approval API at revision 20240223 .

You can set the scope for this method like this: accessapproval1 --scope <scope> projects update-access-approval-settings ... Required Scalar Argument <name> (string) The resource name of the settings. Format is one of: * \"projects/{project}/accessApprovalSettings\" * \"folders/{folder}/accessApprovalSettings\" * \"organizations/{organization}/accessApprovalSettings\" Required Request Value The request value is a data-structure with various fields. Each field may be a simple scalar or another data-structure. In the latter case it is advised to set the field-cursor to the data-structure's field to specify values more concisely. For example, a structure like this: AccessApprovalSettings: active-key-version: string ancestor-has-active-key-version: boolean enrolled-ancestor: boolean invalid-key-version: boolean name: string notification-emails: [string] notification-pubsub-topic: string prefer-no-broad-approval-requests: boolean preferred-request-expiration-days: integer can be set completely with the following arguments which are assumed to be executed in the given order. Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time. -r . active-key-version=est The asymmetric crypto key version to use for signing approval requests. Empty active_key_version indicates that a Google-managed key should be used for signing. This property will be ignored if set by an ancestor of this resource, and new non-empty values may not be set. ancestor-has-active-key-version=true Output only. This field is read only (not settable via UpdateAccessApprovalSettings method). If the field is true, that indicates that an ancestor of this Project or Folder has set active_key_version (this field will always be unset for the organization since organizations do not have ancestors). enrolled-ancestor=false Output only. This field is read only (not settable via UpdateAccessApprovalSettings method). If the field is true, that indicates that at least one service is enrolled for Access Approval in one or more ancestors of the Project or Folder (this field will always be unset for the organization since organizations do not have ancestors). invalid-key-version=true Output only. This field is read only (not settable via UpdateAccessApprovalSettings method). If the field is true, that indicates that there is some configuration issue with the active_key_version configured at this level in the resource hierarchy (e.g. it doesn't exist or the Access Approval service account doesn't have the correct permissions on it, etc.) This key version is not necessarily the effective key version at this level, as key versions are inherited top-down. name=eos The resource name of the settings. Format is one of: * \"projects/{project}/accessApprovalSettings\" * \"folders/{folder}/accessApprovalSettings\" * \"organizations/{organization}/accessApprovalSettings\" notification-emails=labore A list of email addresses to which notifications relating to approval requests should be sent. Notifications relating to a resource will be sent to all emails in the settings of ancestor resources of that resource. A maximum of 50 email addresses are allowed. Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. notification-pubsub-topic=sed Optional. A pubsub topic to which notifications relating to approval requests should be sent. prefer-no-broad-approval-requests=false This preference is communicated to Google personnel when sending an approval request but can be overridden if necessary. preferred-request-expiration-days=21 This preference is shared with Google personnel, but can be overridden if said personnel deems necessary. The approver ultimately can set the expiration at approval time. About Cursors The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. . Each additional . moves it up one additional level. E.g. ... would go three levels up. Optional Output Flags The method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default. -o out out specifies the destination to which to write the server's result to. It will be a JSON-encoded structure. The destination may be - to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes. If unset, it defaults to standard output. Optional Method Properties You may set the following properties to further configure the call. Please note that -p is followed by one or more key-value-pairs, and is called like this -p k1=v1 k2=v2 even though the listing below repeats the -p for completeness. -p update-mask=string The update mask applies to the settings. Only the top level fields of AccessApprovalSettings (notification_emails & enrolled_services) are supported. For each field, if it is included, the currently stored value will be entirely overwritten with the value of the field passed in this request.
