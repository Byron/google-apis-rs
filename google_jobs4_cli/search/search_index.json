By default all output is printed to standard out, but flags can be set to direct it into a file independent of your shell's capabilities. Errors will be printed to standard error, and cause the program's exit code to be non-zero. If data-structures are requested, these will be returned as pretty-printed JSON, to be useful as input to other tools. Everything else about the Cloud Talent Solution API can be found at the official documentation site . Installation and Source Code Install the command-line interface with cargo using: cargo install google-jobs4-cli Find the source code on github .

Defaults to a user-writable directory that we will create during the first invocation. [default: ~/.google-service-cli] Configuration The program will store all persistent data in the ~/.google-service-cli directory in JSON files prefixed with jobs4- . You can change the directory used to store configuration with the --config-dir flag on a per-invocation basis. More information about the various kinds of persistent data are given in the following paragraphs. Authentication Most APIs require a user to authenticate any request. If this is the case, the scope determines the set of permissions granted. The granularity of these is usually no more than read-only or full-access . If not set, the system will automatically select the smallest feasible scope, e.g. when invoking a method that is read-only, it will ask only for a read-only scope. You may use the --scope flag to specify a scope directly. All applicable scopes are documented in the respective method's CLI documentation. The first time a scope is used, the user is asked for permission. Follow the instructions given by the CLI to grant permissions, or to decline. If a scope was authenticated by the user, the respective information will be stored as JSON in the configuration directory, e.g. ~/.google-service-cli/jobs4-token-<scope-hash>.json . No manual management of these tokens is necessary. To revoke granted authentication, please refer to the official documentation . Application Secrets In order to allow any application to use Google services, it will need to be registered using the Google Developer Console . APIs the application may use are then enabled for it one by one. Most APIs can be used for free and have a daily quota. To allow more comfortable usage of the CLI without forcing anyone to register an own application, the CLI comes with a default application secret that is configured accordingly. This also means that heavy usage all around the world may deplete the daily quota. You can workaround this limitation by putting your own secrets file at this location: ~/.google-service-cli/jobs4-secret.json , assuming that the required jobs API was enabled for it. Such a secret file can be downloaded in the Google Developer Console at APIs & auth -> Credentials -> Download JSON and used as is. Learn more about how to setup Google projects and enable APIs using the official documentation . Debugging Even though the CLI does its best to provide usable error messages, sometimes it might be desirable to know what exactly led to a particular issue. This is done by allowing all client-server communication to be output to standard error as-is . The --debug flag will print errors using the Debug representation to standard error. You may consider redirecting standard error into a file for ease of use, e.g. jobs4 --debug <resource> <method> [options] 2>debug.txt .","title":"Home"},{"location":"#installation-and-source-code","text":"Install the command-line interface with cargo using: cargo install google-jobs4-cli Find the source code on github .","title":"Installation and Source Code"},{"location":"#usage","text":"This documentation was generated from the Cloud Talent Solution API at revision 20240202 .

It must be in the range [-90.0, +90.0]. longitude=0.8243737469076314 The longitude in degrees. It must be in the range [-180.0, +180.0]. .. location-type=amet. The type of a location, which corresponds to the address lines field of google.type.PostalAddress. For example, \"Downtown, Atlanta, GA, USA\" has a type of LocationType.NEIGHBORHOOD, and \"Kansas City, KS, USA\" has a type of LocationType.LOCALITY. postal-address address-lines=duo Unstructured address lines describing the lower levels of an address. Because values in address_lines do not have type information and may sometimes contain multiple values in a single field (e.g. \"Austin, TX\"), it is important that the line order is clear. The order of address lines should be \"envelope order\" for the country/region of the address. In places where this can vary (e.g. Japan), address_language is used to make it explicit (e.g. \"ja\" for large-to-small ordering and \"ja-Latn\" or \"en\" for small-to-large). This way, the most specific line of an address can be selected based on the language. The minimum permitted structural representation of an address consists of a region_code with all remaining information placed in the address_lines. It would be possible to format such an address very approximately without geocoding, but no semantic reasoning could be made about any of the address components until it was at least partially resolved. Creating an address only containing a region_code and address_lines, and then geocoding is the recommended way to handle completely unstructured addresses (as opposed to guessing which parts of the address should be localities or administrative areas). Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. administrative-area=ipsum Optional. Highest administrative subdivision which is used for postal addresses of a country or region. For example, this can be a state, a province, an oblast, or a prefecture. Specifically, for Spain this is the province and not the autonomous community (e.g. \"Barcelona\" and not \"Catalonia\"). Many countries don't use an administrative area in postal addresses. E.g. in Switzerland this should be left unpopulated. language-code=gubergren Optional. BCP-47 language code of the contents of this address (if known). This is often the UI language of the input form or is expected to match one of the languages used in the address' country/region, or their transliterated equivalents. This can affect formatting in certain countries, but is not critical to the correctness of the data and will never affect any validation or other non-formatting related operations. If this value is not known, it should be omitted (rather than specifying a possibly incorrect default). Examples: \"zh-Hant\", \"ja\", \"ja-Latn\", \"en\". locality=lorem Optional. Generally refers to the city/town portion of the address. Examples: US city, IT comune, UK post town. In regions of the world where localities are not well defined or do not fit into this structure well, leave locality empty and use address_lines. organization=gubergren Optional. The name of the organization at the address. postal-code=eos Optional. Postal code of the address. Not all countries use or require postal codes to be present, but where they are used, they may trigger additional validation with other parts of the address (e.g. state/zip validation in the U.S.A.). recipients=dolor Optional. The recipient at the address. This field may, under certain circumstances, contain multiline information. For example, it might contain \"care of\" information. Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. region-code=ea Required. CLDR region code of the country/region of the address. This is never inferred and it is up to the user to ensure the value is correct. See https://cldr.unicode.org/ and https://www.unicode.org/cldr/charts/30/supplemental/territory_information.html for details. Example: \"CH\" for Switzerland. revision=46 The schema revision of the PostalAddress . This must be set to 0, which is the latest revision. All new revisions must be backward compatible with old revisions. sorting-code=invidunt Optional. Additional, country-specific, sorting code. This is not used in most regions. Where it is used, the value is either a string like \"CEDEX\", optionally followed by a number (e.g. \"CEDEX 7\"), or just a number alone, representing the \"sector code\" (Jamaica), \"delivery area indicator\" (Malawi) or \"post office indicator\" (e.g. C\u00f4te d'Ivoire). sublocality=amet Optional. Sublocality of the address. For example, this can be neighborhoods, boroughs, districts. .. radius-miles=0.8204376297831348 Radius in miles of the job location. This value is derived from the location bounding box in which a circle with the specified radius centered from google.type.LatLng covers the area associated with the job location. For example, currently, \"Mountain View, CA, USA\" has a radius of 6.17 miles. ... display-name=ipsum Required. The display name of the company, for example, \"Google LLC\". eeo-text=sed Equal Employment Opportunity legal disclaimer text to be associated with all jobs, and typically to be displayed in all roles. The maximum number of allowed characters is 500. external-id=ut Required. Client side company identifier, used to uniquely identify the company. The maximum number of allowed characters is 255. headquarters-address=gubergren The street address of the company's main headquarters, which may be different from the job location. The service attempts to geolocate the provided address, and populates a more specific location wherever possible in DerivedInfo.headquarters_location. hiring-agency=true Set to true if it is the hiring agency that post jobs for other employers. Defaults to false if not provided. image-uri=ipsum A URI that hosts the employer's company logo. keyword-searchable-job-custom-attributes=ipsum This field is deprecated. Please set the searchability of the custom attribute in the Job.custom_attributes going forward. A list of keys of filterable Job.custom_attributes, whose corresponding string_values are used in keyword searches. Jobs with string_values under these specified field keys are returned if any of the values match the search keyword. Custom field values with parenthesis, brackets and special symbols are not searchable as-is, and those keyword queries must be surrounded by quotes. Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. name=est Required during company update. The resource name for a company. This is generated by the service when a company is created. The format is \"projects/{project_id}/tenants/{tenant_id}/companies/{company_id}\", for example, \"projects/foo/tenants/bar/companies/baz\". size=gubergren The employer's company size. suspended=false Output only. Indicates whether a company is flagged to be suspended from public availability by the service when job content appears suspicious, abusive, or spammy. website-uri=lorem The URI representing the company's primary web site or home page, for example, \"https://www.google.com\". The maximum number of allowed characters is 255. About Cursors The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. . Each additional . moves it up one additional level. E.g. ... would go three levels up. Optional Output Flags The method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default. -o out out specifies the destination to which to write the server's result to. It will be a JSON-encoded structure. The destination may be - to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes. If unset, it defaults to standard output.

The type of a location, which corresponds to the address lines field of google.type.PostalAddress. For example, \"Downtown, Atlanta, GA, USA\" has a type of LocationType.NEIGHBORHOOD, and \"Kansas City, KS, USA\" has a type of LocationType.LOCALITY. postal-address address-lines=duo Unstructured address lines describing the lower levels of an address. Because values in address_lines do not have type information and may sometimes contain multiple values in a single field (e.g. \"Austin, TX\"), it is important that the line order is clear. The order of address lines should be \"envelope order\" for the country/region of the address. In places where this can vary (e.g. Japan), address_language is used to make it explicit (e.g. \"ja\" for large-to-small ordering and \"ja-Latn\" or \"en\" for small-to-large). This way, the most specific line of an address can be selected based on the language. The minimum permitted structural representation of an address consists of a region_code with all remaining information placed in the address_lines. It would be possible to format such an address very approximately without geocoding, but no semantic reasoning could be made about any of the address components until it was at least partially resolved. Creating an address only containing a region_code and address_lines, and then geocoding is the recommended way to handle completely unstructured addresses (as opposed to guessing which parts of the address should be localities or administrative areas). Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. administrative-area=ipsum Optional. Highest administrative subdivision which is used for postal addresses of a country or region. For example, this can be a state, a province, an oblast, or a prefecture. Specifically, for Spain this is the province and not the autonomous community (e.g. \"Barcelona\" and not \"Catalonia\"). Many countries don't use an administrative area in postal addresses. E.g. in Switzerland this should be left unpopulated. language-code=gubergren Optional. BCP-47 language code of the contents of this address (if known). This is often the UI language of the input form or is expected to match one of the languages used in the address' country/region, or their transliterated equivalents. This can affect formatting in certain countries, but is not critical to the correctness of the data and will never affect any validation or other non-formatting related operations. If this value is not known, it should be omitted (rather than specifying a possibly incorrect default). Examples: \"zh-Hant\", \"ja\", \"ja-Latn\", \"en\". locality=lorem Optional. Generally refers to the city/town portion of the address. Examples: US city, IT comune, UK post town. In regions of the world where localities are not well defined or do not fit into this structure well, leave locality empty and use address_lines. organization=gubergren Optional. The name of the organization at the address. postal-code=eos Optional. Postal code of the address. Not all countries use or require postal codes to be present, but where they are used, they may trigger additional validation with other parts of the address (e.g. state/zip validation in the U.S.A.). recipients=dolor Optional. The recipient at the address. This field may, under certain circumstances, contain multiline information. For example, it might contain \"care of\" information. Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. region-code=ea Required. CLDR region code of the country/region of the address. This is never inferred and it is up to the user to ensure the value is correct. See https://cldr.unicode.org/ and https://www.unicode.org/cldr/charts/30/supplemental/territory_information.html for details. Example: \"CH\" for Switzerland. revision=46 The schema revision of the PostalAddress . This must be set to 0, which is the latest revision. All new revisions must be backward compatible with old revisions. sorting-code=invidunt Optional. Additional, country-specific, sorting code. This is not used in most regions. Where it is used, the value is either a string like \"CEDEX\", optionally followed by a number (e.g. \"CEDEX 7\"), or just a number alone, representing the \"sector code\" (Jamaica), \"delivery area indicator\" (Malawi) or \"post office indicator\" (e.g. C\u00f4te d'Ivoire). sublocality=amet Optional. Sublocality of the address. For example, this can be neighborhoods, boroughs, districts. .. radius-miles=0.8204376297831348 Radius in miles of the job location. This value is derived from the location bounding box in which a circle with the specified radius centered from google.type.LatLng covers the area associated with the job location. For example, currently, \"Mountain View, CA, USA\" has a radius of 6.17 miles. ... display-name=ipsum Required. The display name of the company, for example, \"Google LLC\". eeo-text=sed Equal Employment Opportunity legal disclaimer text to be associated with all jobs, and typically to be displayed in all roles. The maximum number of allowed characters is 500. external-id=ut Required. Client side company identifier, used to uniquely identify the company. The maximum number of allowed characters is 255. headquarters-address=gubergren The street address of the company's main headquarters, which may be different from the job location. The service attempts to geolocate the provided address, and populates a more specific location wherever possible in DerivedInfo.headquarters_location. hiring-agency=true Set to true if it is the hiring agency that post jobs for other employers. Defaults to false if not provided. image-uri=ipsum A URI that hosts the employer's company logo. keyword-searchable-job-custom-attributes=ipsum This field is deprecated. Please set the searchability of the custom attribute in the Job.custom_attributes going forward. A list of keys of filterable Job.custom_attributes, whose corresponding string_values are used in keyword searches.

Creating an address only containing a region_code and address_lines, and then geocoding is the recommended way to handle completely unstructured addresses (as opposed to guessing which parts of the address should be localities or administrative areas). Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. administrative-area=stet Optional. Highest administrative subdivision which is used for postal addresses of a country or region. For example, this can be a state, a province, an oblast, or a prefecture. Specifically, for Spain this is the province and not the autonomous community (e.g. \"Barcelona\" and not \"Catalonia\"). Many countries don't use an administrative area in postal addresses. E.g. in Switzerland this should be left unpopulated. language-code=kasd Optional. BCP-47 language code of the contents of this address (if known). This is often the UI language of the input form or is expected to match one of the languages used in the address' country/region, or their transliterated equivalents. This can affect formatting in certain countries, but is not critical to the correctness of the data and will never affect any validation or other non-formatting related operations. If this value is not known, it should be omitted (rather than specifying a possibly incorrect default). Examples: \"zh-Hant\", \"ja\", \"ja-Latn\", \"en\". locality=et Optional. Generally refers to the city/town portion of the address. Examples: US city, IT comune, UK post town. In regions of the world where localities are not well defined or do not fit into this structure well, leave locality empty and use address_lines. organization=sed Optional. The name of the organization at the address. postal-code=et Optional. Postal code of the address. Not all countries use or require postal codes to be present, but where they are used, they may trigger additional validation with other parts of the address (e.g. state/zip validation in the U.S.A.). recipients=et Optional. The recipient at the address. This field may, under certain circumstances, contain multiline information. For example, it might contain \"care of\" information. Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. region-code=vero Required. CLDR region code of the country/region of the address. This is never inferred and it is up to the user to ensure the value is correct. See https://cldr.unicode.org/ and https://www.unicode.org/cldr/charts/30/supplemental/territory_information.html for details. Example: \"CH\" for Switzerland. revision=70 The schema revision of the PostalAddress . This must be set to 0, which is the latest revision. All new revisions must be backward compatible with old revisions. sorting-code=sed Optional. Additional, country-specific, sorting code. This is not used in most regions. Where it is used, the value is either a string like \"CEDEX\", optionally followed by a number (e.g. \"CEDEX 7\"), or just a number alone, representing the \"sector code\" (Jamaica), \"delivery area indicator\" (Malawi) or \"post office indicator\" (e.g. C\u00f4te d'Ivoire). sublocality=duo Optional. Sublocality of the address. For example, this can be neighborhoods, boroughs, districts. .. radius-miles=0.5254434270373415 Radius in miles of the job location. This value is derived from the location bounding box in which a circle with the specified radius centered from google.type.LatLng covers the area associated with the job location. For example, currently, \"Mountain View, CA, USA\" has a radius of 6.17 miles. ... display-name=et Required. The display name of the company, for example, \"Google LLC\". eeo-text=voluptua. Equal Employment Opportunity legal disclaimer text to be associated with all jobs, and typically to be displayed in all roles. The maximum number of allowed characters is 500. external-id=amet. Required. Client side company identifier, used to uniquely identify the company. The maximum number of allowed characters is 255. headquarters-address=consetetur The street address of the company's main headquarters, which may be different from the job location. The service attempts to geolocate the provided address, and populates a more specific location wherever possible in DerivedInfo.headquarters_location. hiring-agency=false Set to true if it is the hiring agency that post jobs for other employers. Defaults to false if not provided. image-uri=dolor A URI that hosts the employer's company logo. keyword-searchable-job-custom-attributes=et This field is deprecated. Please set the searchability of the custom attribute in the Job.custom_attributes going forward. A list of keys of filterable Job.custom_attributes, whose corresponding string_values are used in keyword searches. Jobs with string_values under these specified field keys are returned if any of the values match the search keyword. Custom field values with parenthesis, brackets and special symbols are not searchable as-is, and those keyword queries must be surrounded by quotes. Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. name=et Required during company update. The resource name for a company. This is generated by the service when a company is created. The format is \"projects/{project_id}/tenants/{tenant_id}/companies/{company_id}\", for example, \"projects/foo/tenants/bar/companies/baz\". size=sadipscing The employer's company size. suspended=false Output only. Indicates whether a company is flagged to be suspended from public availability by the service when job content appears suspicious, abusive, or spammy. website-uri=duo The URI representing the company's primary web site or home page, for example, \"https://www.google.com\". The maximum number of allowed characters is 255. About Cursors The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. . Each additional . moves it up one additional level. E.g. ... would go three levels up. Optional Output Flags The method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default. -o out out specifies the destination to which to write the server's result to. It will be a JSON-encoded structure. The destination may be - to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes. If unset, it defaults to standard output. Optional Method Properties You may set the following properties to further configure the call. Please note that -p is followed by one or more key-value-pairs, and is called like this -p k1=v1 k2=v2 even though the listing below repeats the -p for completeness. -p update-mask=string Strongly recommended for the best service experience. If update_mask is provided, only the specified fields in company are updated. Otherwise all the fields are updated. A field mask to specify the company fields to be updated.

Because values in address_lines do not have type information and may sometimes contain multiple values in a single field (e.g. \"Austin, TX\"), it is important that the line order is clear. The order of address lines should be \"envelope order\" for the country/region of the address. In places where this can vary (e.g. Japan), address_language is used to make it explicit (e.g. \"ja\" for large-to-small ordering and \"ja-Latn\" or \"en\" for small-to-large).

Location(s) where the employer is looking to hire for this job posting. Specifying the full street address(es) of the hiring location enables better API results, especially job searches by commute time. At most 50 locations are allowed for best search performance. If a job has more locations, it is suggested to split it into multiple jobs with unique requisition_ids (e.g. 'ReqA' becomes 'ReqA-1', 'ReqA-2', and so on.) as multiple jobs with the same company, language_code and requisition_id are not allowed. If the original requisition_id must be preserved, a custom field should be used for storage. It is also suggested to group the locations that close to each other in the same job for better search experience. Jobs with multiple addresses must have their addresses with the same LocationType to allow location filtering to work properly. (For example, a Job with addresses \"1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA, USA\" and \"London, UK\" may not have location filters applied correctly at search time since the first is a LocationType.STREET_ADDRESS and the second is a LocationType.LOCALITY.)

The description of the job, which typically includes a multi-paragraph description of the company and related information. Separate fields are provided on the job object for responsibilities, qualifications, and other job characteristics. Use of these separate job fields is recommended. This field accepts and sanitizes HTML input, and also accepts bold, italic, ordered list, and unordered list markup tags. The maximum number of allowed characters is 100,000. employment-types=dolore The employment type(s) of a job, for example, full time or part time.

Invalid timestamps are ignored. job-level=ea The experience level associated with the job, such as \"Entry Level\". job-start-time=sadipscing The start timestamp of the job in UTC time zone. Typically this field is used for contracting engagements. Invalid timestamps are ignored. language-code=lorem The language of the posting. This field is distinct from any requirements for fluency that are associated with the job. Language codes must be in BCP-47 format, such as \"en-US\" or \"sr-Latn\". For more information, see Tags for Identifying Languages {: class=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" }. If this field is unspecified and Job.description is present, detected language code based on Job.description is assigned, otherwise defaults to 'en_US'. name=invidunt Required during job update. The resource name for the job. This is generated by the service when a job is created. The format is \"projects/{project_id}/tenants/{tenant_id}/jobs/{job_id}\". For example, \"projects/foo/tenants/bar/jobs/baz\". Use of this field in job queries and API calls is preferred over the use of requisition_id since this value is unique. posting-create-time=no Output only. The timestamp when this job posting was created. posting-expire-time=est Strongly recommended for the best service experience. The expiration timestamp of the job. After this timestamp, the job is marked as expired, and it no longer appears in search results. The expired job can't be listed by the ListJobs API, but it can be retrieved with the GetJob API or updated with the UpdateJob API or deleted with the DeleteJob API. An expired job can be updated and opened again by using a future expiration timestamp. Updating an expired job fails if there is another existing open job with same company, language_code and requisition_id. The expired jobs are retained in our system for 90 days. However, the overall expired job count cannot exceed 3 times the maximum number of open jobs over previous 7 days. If this threshold is exceeded, expired jobs are cleaned out in order of earliest expire time. Expired jobs are no longer accessible after they are cleaned out. Invalid timestamps are ignored, and treated as expire time not provided. If the timestamp is before the instant request is made, the job is treated as expired immediately on creation. This kind of job can not be updated. And when creating a job with past timestamp, the posting_publish_time must be set before posting_expire_time. The purpose of this feature is to allow other objects, such as Application, to refer a job that didn't exist in the system prior to becoming expired. If you want to modify a job that was expired on creation, delete it and create a new one. If this value isn't provided at the time of job creation or is invalid, the job posting expires after 30 days from the job's creation time. For example, if the job was created on 2017/01/01 13:00AM UTC with an unspecified expiration date, the job expires after 2017/01/31 13:00AM UTC. If this value isn't provided on job update, it depends on the field masks set by UpdateJobRequest.update_mask. If the field masks include job_end_time, or the masks are empty meaning that every field is updated, the job posting expires after 30 days from the job's last update time. Otherwise the expiration date isn't updated. posting-publish-time=at The timestamp this job posting was most recently published. The default value is the time the request arrives at the server. Invalid timestamps are ignored. posting-region=sed The job PostingRegion (for example, state, country) throughout which the job is available. If this field is set, a LocationFilter in a search query within the job region finds this job posting if an exact location match isn't specified. If this field is set to PostingRegion.NATION or PostingRegion.ADMINISTRATIVE_AREA, setting job Job.addresses to the same location level as this field is strongly recommended. posting-update-time=sit Output only. The timestamp when this job posting was last updated. processing-options disable-street-address-resolution=true If set to true , the service does not attempt to resolve a more precise address for the job. html-sanitization=aliquyam Option for job HTML content sanitization. Applied fields are: * description * applicationInfo.instruction * incentives * qualifications * responsibilities HTML tags in these fields may be stripped if sanitiazation isn't disabled. Defaults to HtmlSanitization.SIMPLE_FORMATTING_ONLY. .. promotion-value=96 A promotion value of the job, as determined by the client. The value determines the sort order of the jobs returned when searching for jobs using the featured jobs search call, with higher promotional values being returned first and ties being resolved by relevance sort. Only the jobs with a promotionValue >0 are returned in a FEATURED_JOB_SEARCH. Default value is 0, and negative values are treated as 0. qualifications=et A description of the qualifications required to perform the job. The use of this field is recommended as an alternative to using the more general description field. This field accepts and sanitizes HTML input, and also accepts bold, italic, ordered list, and unordered list markup tags. The maximum number of allowed characters is 10,000. requisition-id=sanctus Required. The requisition ID, also referred to as the posting ID, is assigned by the client to identify a job. This field is intended to be used by clients for client identification and tracking of postings. A job isn't allowed to be created if there is another job with the same company, language_code and requisition_id. The maximum number of allowed characters is 255. responsibilities=lorem A description of job responsibilities. The use of this field is recommended as an alternative to using the more general description field. This field accepts and sanitizes HTML input, and also accepts bold, italic, ordered list, and unordered list markup tags. The maximum number of allowed characters is 10,000. title=est Required. The title of the job, such as \"Software Engineer\" The maximum number of allowed characters is 500. visibility=sed Deprecated. The job is only visible to the owner. The visibility of the job. Defaults to Visibility.ACCOUNT_ONLY if not specified. About Cursors The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. . Each additional . moves it up one additional level. E.g. ... would go three levels up. Optional Output Flags The method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default. -o out out specifies the destination to which to write the server's result to. It will be a JSON-encoded structure. The destination may be - to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes. If unset, it defaults to standard output.

Location(s) where the employer is looking to hire for this job posting. Specifying the full street address(es) of the hiring location enables better API results, especially job searches by commute time. At most 50 locations are allowed for best search performance. If a job has more locations, it is suggested to split it into multiple jobs with unique requisition_ids (e.g. 'ReqA' becomes 'ReqA-1', 'ReqA-2', and so on.) as multiple jobs with the same company, language_code and requisition_id are not allowed. If the original requisition_id must be preserved, a custom field should be used for storage. It is also suggested to group the locations that close to each other in the same job for better search experience. Jobs with multiple addresses must have their addresses with the same LocationType to allow location filtering to work properly. (For example, a Job with addresses \"1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA, USA\" and \"London, UK\" may not have location filters applied correctly at search time since the first is a LocationType.STREET_ADDRESS and the second is a LocationType.LOCALITY.)

The description of the job, which typically includes a multi-paragraph description of the company and related information. Separate fields are provided on the job object for responsibilities, qualifications, and other job characteristics. Use of these separate job fields is recommended. This field accepts and sanitizes HTML input, and also accepts bold, italic, ordered list, and unordered list markup tags. The maximum number of allowed characters is 100,000. employment-types=consetetur The employment type(s) of a job, for example, full time or part time. Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. incentives=consetetur A description of bonus, commission, and other compensation incentives associated with the job not including salary or pay. The maximum number of allowed characters is 10,000. job-benefits=stet The benefits included with the job. Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. job-end-time=est The end timestamp of the job. Typically this field is used for contracting engagements. Invalid timestamps are ignored. job-level=aliquyam The experience level associated with the job, such as \"Entry Level\". job-start-time=elitr The start timestamp of the job in UTC time zone. Typically this field is used for contracting engagements. Invalid timestamps are ignored. language-code=duo The language of the posting. This field is distinct from any requirements for fluency that are associated with the job. Language codes must be in BCP-47 format, such as \"en-US\" or \"sr-Latn\". For more information, see Tags for Identifying Languages {: class=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" }. If this field is unspecified and Job.description is present, detected language code based on Job.description is assigned, otherwise defaults to 'en_US'. name=diam Required during job update. The resource name for the job. This is generated by the service when a job is created. The format is \"projects/{project_id}/tenants/{tenant_id}/jobs/{job_id}\". For example, \"projects/foo/tenants/bar/jobs/baz\". Use of this field in job queries and API calls is preferred over the use of requisition_id since this value is unique. posting-create-time=est Output only. The timestamp when this job posting was created. posting-expire-time=sit Strongly recommended for the best service experience. The expiration timestamp of the job. After this timestamp, the job is marked as expired, and it no longer appears in search results. The expired job can't be listed by the ListJobs API, but it can be retrieved with the GetJob API or updated with the UpdateJob API or deleted with the DeleteJob API. An expired job can be updated and opened again by using a future expiration timestamp. Updating an expired job fails if there is another existing open job with same company, language_code and requisition_id. The expired jobs are retained in our system for 90 days. However, the overall expired job count cannot exceed 3 times the maximum number of open jobs over previous 7 days. If this threshold is exceeded, expired jobs are cleaned out in order of earliest expire time. Expired jobs are no longer accessible after they are cleaned out. Invalid timestamps are ignored, and treated as expire time not provided. If the timestamp is before the instant request is made, the job is treated as expired immediately on creation. This kind of job can not be updated. And when creating a job with past timestamp, the posting_publish_time must be set before posting_expire_time. The purpose of this feature is to allow other objects, such as Application, to refer a job that didn't exist in the system prior to becoming expired. If you want to modify a job that was expired on creation, delete it and create a new one. If this value isn't provided at the time of job creation or is invalid, the job posting expires after 30 days from the job's creation time. For example, if the job was created on 2017/01/01 13:00AM UTC with an unspecified expiration date, the job expires after 2017/01/31 13:00AM UTC. If this value isn't provided on job update, it depends on the field masks set by UpdateJobRequest.update_mask. If the field masks include job_end_time, or the masks are empty meaning that every field is updated, the job posting expires after 30 days from the job's last update time. Otherwise the expiration date isn't updated. posting-publish-time=sed The timestamp this job posting was most recently published. The default value is the time the request arrives at the server. Invalid timestamps are ignored. posting-region=eos The job PostingRegion (for example, state, country) throughout which the job is available. If this field is set, a LocationFilter in a search query within the job region finds this job posting if an exact location match isn't specified. If this field is set to PostingRegion.NATION or PostingRegion.ADMINISTRATIVE_AREA, setting job Job.addresses to the same location level as this field is strongly recommended. posting-update-time=lorem Output only. The timestamp when this job posting was last updated. processing-options disable-street-address-resolution=true If set to true , the service does not attempt to resolve a more precise address for the job. html-sanitization=sea Option for job HTML content sanitization. Applied fields are: * description * applicationInfo.instruction * incentives * qualifications * responsibilities HTML tags in these fields may be stripped if sanitiazation isn't disabled. Defaults to HtmlSanitization.SIMPLE_FORMATTING_ONLY. .. promotion-value=27 A promotion value of the job, as determined by the client. The value determines the sort order of the jobs returned when searching for jobs using the featured jobs search call, with higher promotional values being returned first and ties being resolved by relevance sort. Only the jobs with a promotionValue >0 are returned in a FEATURED_JOB_SEARCH. Default value is 0, and negative values are treated as 0. qualifications=at A description of the qualifications required to perform the job. The use of this field is recommended as an alternative to using the more general description field. This field accepts and sanitizes HTML input, and also accepts bold, italic, ordered list, and unordered list markup tags. The maximum number of allowed characters is 10,000. requisition-id=dolore Required. The requisition ID, also referred to as the posting ID, is assigned by the client to identify a job.

The title of the job, such as \"Software Engineer\" The maximum number of allowed characters is 500. visibility=accusam Deprecated. The job is only visible to the owner. The visibility of the job. Defaults to Visibility.ACCOUNT_ONLY if not specified. About Cursors The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. . Each additional . moves it up one additional level. E.g. ... would go three levels up. Optional Output Flags The method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default. -o out out specifies the destination to which to write the server's result to. It will be a JSON-encoded structure. The destination may be - to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes. If unset, it defaults to standard output. Optional Method Properties You may set the following properties to further configure the call. Please note that -p is followed by one or more key-value-pairs, and is called like this -p k1=v1 k2=v2 even though the listing below repeats the -p for completeness. -p update-mask=string Strongly recommended for the best service experience. If update_mask is provided, only the specified fields in job are updated. Otherwise all the fields are updated. A field mask to restrict the fields that are updated.

Location(s) where the employer is looking to hire for this job posting. Specifying the full street address(es) of the hiring location enables better API results, especially job searches by commute time. At most 50 locations are allowed for best search performance. If a job has more locations, it is suggested to split it into multiple jobs with unique requisition_ids (e.g. 'ReqA' becomes 'ReqA-1', 'ReqA-2', and so on.) as multiple jobs with the same company, language_code and requisition_id are not allowed. If the original requisition_id must be preserved, a custom field should be used for storage. It is also suggested to group the locations that close to each other in the same job for better search experience. Jobs with multiple addresses must have their addresses with the same LocationType to allow location filtering to work properly. (For example, a Job with addresses \"1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA, USA\" and \"London, UK\" may not have location filters applied correctly at search time since the first is a LocationType.STREET_ADDRESS and the second is a LocationType.LOCALITY.) If a job needs to have multiple addresses, it is suggested to split it into multiple jobs with same LocationTypes. The maximum number of allowed characters is 500. Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. application-info emails=dolores Use this field to specify email address(es) to which resumes or applications can be sent. The maximum number of allowed characters for each entry is 255. Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. instruction=dolores Use this field to provide instructions, such as \"Mail your application to ...\", that a candidate can follow to apply for the job.

Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. department=est The department or functional area within the company with the open position. The maximum number of allowed characters is 255. derived-info job-categories=et Job categories derived from Job.title and Job.description. Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. .. description=sea Required. The description of the job, which typically includes a multi-paragraph description of the company and related information. Separate fields are provided on the job object for responsibilities, qualifications, and other job characteristics. Use of these separate job fields is recommended. This field accepts and sanitizes HTML input, and also accepts bold, italic, ordered list, and unordered list markup tags. The maximum number of allowed characters is 100,000. employment-types=consetetur The employment type(s) of a job, for example, full time or part time. Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. incentives=consetetur A description of bonus, commission, and other compensation incentives associated with the job not including salary or pay. The maximum number of allowed characters is 10,000. job-benefits=stet The benefits included with the job. Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. job-end-time=est The end timestamp of the job. Typically this field is used for contracting engagements. Invalid timestamps are ignored. job-level=aliquyam The experience level associated with the job, such as \"Entry Level\". job-start-time=elitr The start timestamp of the job in UTC time zone. Typically this field is used for contracting engagements. Invalid timestamps are ignored. language-code=duo The language of the posting. This field is distinct from any requirements for fluency that are associated with the job. Language codes must be in BCP-47 format, such as \"en-US\" or \"sr-Latn\". For more information, see Tags for Identifying Languages {: class=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" }. If this field is unspecified and Job.description is present, detected language code based on Job.description is assigned, otherwise defaults to 'en_US'. name=diam Required during job update. The resource name for the job. This is generated by the service when a job is created. The format is \"projects/{project_id}/tenants/{tenant_id}/jobs/{job_id}\". For example, \"projects/foo/tenants/bar/jobs/baz\". Use of this field in job queries and API calls is preferred over the use of requisition_id since this value is unique. posting-create-time=est Output only. The timestamp when this job posting was created. posting-expire-time=sit Strongly recommended for the best service experience. The expiration timestamp of the job. After this timestamp, the job is marked as expired, and it no longer appears in search results. The expired job can't be listed by the ListJobs API, but it can be retrieved with the GetJob API or updated with the UpdateJob API or deleted with the DeleteJob API. An expired job can be updated and opened again by using a future expiration timestamp. Updating an expired job fails if there is another existing open job with same company, language_code and requisition_id. The expired jobs are retained in our system for 90 days. However, the overall expired job count cannot exceed 3 times the maximum number of open jobs over previous 7 days. If this threshold is exceeded, expired jobs are cleaned out in order of earliest expire time. Expired jobs are no longer accessible after they are cleaned out. Invalid timestamps are ignored, and treated as expire time not provided. If the timestamp is before the instant request is made, the job is treated as expired immediately on creation. This kind of job can not be updated. And when creating a job with past timestamp, the posting_publish_time must be set before posting_expire_time. The purpose of this feature is to allow other objects, such as Application, to refer a job that didn't exist in the system prior to becoming expired. If you want to modify a job that was expired on creation, delete it and create a new one. If this value isn't provided at the time of job creation or is invalid, the job posting expires after 30 days from the job's creation time. For example, if the job was created on 2017/01/01 13:00AM UTC with an unspecified expiration date, the job expires after 2017/01/31 13:00AM UTC. If this value isn't provided on job update, it depends on the field masks set by UpdateJobRequest.update_mask. If the field masks include job_end_time, or the masks are empty meaning that every field is updated, the job posting expires after 30 days from the job's last update time. Otherwise the expiration date isn't updated. posting-publish-time=sed The timestamp this job posting was most recently published. The default value is the time the request arrives at the server. Invalid timestamps are ignored. posting-region=eos The job PostingRegion (for example, state, country) throughout which the job is available. If this field is set, a LocationFilter in a search query within the job region finds this job posting if an exact location match isn't specified. If this field is set to PostingRegion.NATION or PostingRegion.ADMINISTRATIVE_AREA, setting job Job.addresses to the same location level as this field is strongly recommended. posting-update-time=lorem Output only. The timestamp when this job posting was last updated. processing-options disable-street-address-resolution=true If set to true , the service does not attempt to resolve a more precise address for the job. html-sanitization=sea Option for job HTML content sanitization. Applied fields are: * description * applicationInfo.instruction * incentives * qualifications * responsibilities HTML tags in these fields may be stripped if sanitiazation isn't disabled. Defaults to HtmlSanitization.SIMPLE_FORMATTING_ONLY. .. promotion-value=27 A promotion value of the job, as determined by the client. The value determines the sort order of the jobs returned when searching for jobs using the featured jobs search call, with higher promotional values being returned first and ties being resolved by relevance sort. Only the jobs with a promotionValue >0 are returned in a FEATURED_JOB_SEARCH. Default value is 0, and negative values are treated as 0. qualifications=at A description of the qualifications required to perform the job. The use of this field is recommended as an alternative to using the more general description field. This field accepts and sanitizes HTML input, and also accepts bold, italic, ordered list, and unordered list markup tags.

This field is intended to be used by clients for client identification and tracking of postings. A job isn't allowed to be created if there is another job with the same company, language_code and requisition_id.

Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time. -r .custom-ranking-info importance-level=sanctus Required. Controls over how important the score of CustomRankingInfo.ranking_expression gets applied to job's final ranking position. An error is thrown if not specified. ranking-expression=nonumy Required. Controls over how job documents get ranked on top of existing relevance score (determined by API algorithm). A combination of the ranking expression and relevance score is used to determine job's final ranking position. The syntax for this expression is a subset of Google SQL syntax. Supported operators are: +, -, *, /, where the left and right side of the operator is either a numeric Job.custom_attributes key, integer/double value or an expression that can be evaluated to a number. Parenthesis are supported to adjust calculation precedence. The expression must be < 200 characters in length. The expression is considered invalid for a job if the expression references custom attributes that are not populated on the job or if the expression results in a divide by zero. If an expression is invalid for a job, that job is demoted to the end of the results. Sample ranking expression (year + 25) * 0.25 - (freshness / 0.5) .. disable-keyword-match=true This field is deprecated. Please use SearchJobsRequest.keyword_match_mode going forward. To migrate, disable_keyword_match set to false maps to KeywordMatchMode.KEYWORD_MATCH_ALL, and disable_keyword_match set to true maps to KeywordMatchMode.KEYWORD_MATCH_DISABLED. If SearchJobsRequest.keyword_match_mode is set, this field is ignored. Controls whether to disable exact keyword match on Job.title, Job.description, Job.company_display_name, Job.addresses, Job.qualifications. When disable keyword match is turned off, a keyword match returns jobs that do not match given category filters when there are matching keywords. For example, for the query \"program manager,\" a result is returned even if the job posting has the title \"software developer,\" which doesn't fall into \"program manager\" ontology, but does have \"program manager\" appearing in its description. For queries like \"cloud\" that don't contain title or location specific ontology, jobs with \"cloud\" keyword matches are returned regardless of this flag's value. Use Company.keyword_searchable_job_custom_attributes if company-specific globally matched custom field/attribute string values are needed. Enabling keyword match improves recall of subsequent search requests. Defaults to false. diversification-level=tempor Controls whether highly similar jobs are returned next to each other in the search results. Jobs are identified as highly similar based on their titles, job categories, and locations. Highly similar results are clustered so that only one representative job of the cluster is displayed to the job seeker higher up in the results, with the other jobs being displayed lower down in the results. Defaults to DiversificationLevel.SIMPLE if no value is specified. enable-broadening=true Controls whether to broaden the search when it produces sparse results. Broadened queries append results to the end of the matching results list. Defaults to false. job-query.commute-filter allow-imprecise-addresses=false If true , jobs without street level addresses may also be returned. For city level addresses, the city center is used. For state and coarser level addresses, text matching is used.

The maximum travel time in seconds. The maximum allowed value is 3600s (one hour). Format is 123s . .. companies=sadipscing This filter specifies the company entities to search against. If a value isn't specified, jobs are searched for against all companies. If multiple values are specified, jobs are searched against the companies specified. The format is \"projects/{project_id}/tenants/{tenant_id}/companies/{company_id}\". For example, \"projects/foo/tenants/bar/companies/baz\". At most 20 company filters are allowed. Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. company-display-names=tempor This filter specifies the company Company.display_name of the jobs to search against. The company name must match the value exactly. Alternatively, the value being searched for can be wrapped in different match operators. SUBSTRING_MATCH([value]) The company name must contain a case insensitive substring match of the value. Using this function may increase latency. Sample Value: SUBSTRING_MATCH(google) MULTI_WORD_TOKEN_MATCH([value]) The value will be treated as a multi word token and the company name must contain a case insensitive match of the value. Using this function may increase latency. Sample Value: MULTI_WORD_TOKEN_MATCH(google) If a value isn't specified, jobs within the search results are associated with any company. If multiple values are specified, jobs within the search results may be associated with any of the specified companies. At most 20 company display name filters are allowed.

For example $-1.75 is represented as units =-1 and nanos =-750,000,000. units=invidunt The whole units of the amount. For example if currencyCode is &#34;USD&#34; , then 1 unit is one US dollar. ... type=clita Required. Type of filter. units=stet Required. Specify desired base compensation entry&#39;s CompensationInfo.CompensationUnit. Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. .. custom-attribute-filter=aliquyam This filter specifies a structured syntax to match against the Job.custom_attributes marked as filterable . The syntax for this expression is a subset of SQL syntax. Supported operators are: = , != , &lt; , &lt;= , &gt; , and &gt;= where the left of the operator is a custom field key and the right of the operator is a number or a quoted string. You must escape backslash (\\) and quote (\\\") characters. Supported functions are LOWER([field_name]) to perform a case insensitive match and EMPTY([field_name]) to filter on the existence of a key. Boolean expressions (AND/OR/NOT) are supported up to 3 levels of nesting (for example, \"((A AND B AND C) OR NOT D) AND E\"), a maximum of 100 comparisons or functions are allowed in the expression. The expression must be < 10000 bytes in length. Sample Query: (LOWER(driving_license)=&#34;class \\&#34;a\\&#34;&#34; OR EMPTY(driving_license)) AND driving_years &gt; 10 disable-spell-check=false This flag controls the spell-check feature. If false, the service attempts to correct a misspelled query, for example, \"enginee\" is corrected to \"engineer\". Defaults to false: a spell check is performed. employment-types=dolores The employment type filter specifies the employment type of jobs to search against, such as EmploymentType.FULL_TIME. If a value isn't specified, jobs in the search results includes any employment type. If multiple values are specified, jobs in the search results include any of the specified employment types. Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. excluded-jobs=sed This filter specifies a list of job names to be excluded during search. At most 400 excluded job names are allowed. Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. job-categories=invidunt The category filter specifies the categories of jobs to search against. See JobCategory for more information. If a value isn't specified, jobs from any category are searched against. If multiple values are specified, jobs from any of the specified categories are searched against. Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. language-codes=clita This filter specifies the locale of jobs to search against, for example, \"en-US\". If a value isn't specified, the search results can contain jobs in any locale. Language codes should be in BCP-47 format, such as \"en-US\" or \"sr-Latn\". For more information, see Tags for Identifying Languages . At most 10 language code filters are allowed. Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. publish-time-range end-time=dolor End of the period (exclusive). start-time=aliquyam Begin of the period (inclusive). .. query=magna The query string that matches against the job title, description, and location fields. The maximum number of allowed characters is 255. query-language-code=diam The language code of query. For example, \"en-US\". This field helps to better interpret the query. If a value isn't specified, the query language code is automatically detected, which may not be accurate. Language code should be in BCP-47 format, such as \"en-US\" or \"sr-Latn\". For more information, see Tags for Identifying Languages . .. job-view=nonumy The desired job attributes returned for jobs in the search response. Defaults to JobView.JOB_VIEW_SMALL if no value is specified. keyword-match-mode=et Controls what keyword match options to use. If both keyword_match_mode and disable_keyword_match are set, keyword_match_mode will take precedence. Defaults to KeywordMatchMode.KEYWORD_MATCH_ALL if no value is specified. max-page-size=93 A limit on the number of jobs returned in the search results. Increasing this value above the default value of 10 can increase search response time. The value can be between 1 and 100. offset=78 An integer that specifies the current offset (that is, starting result location, amongst the jobs deemed by the API as relevant) in search results. This field is only considered if page_token is unset. The maximum allowed value is 5000. Otherwise an error is thrown. For example, 0 means to return results starting from the first matching job, and 10 means to return from the 11th job. This can be used for pagination, (for example, pageSize = 10 and offset = 10 means to return from the second page). order-by=tempor The criteria determining how search results are sorted. Default is &#34;relevance desc&#34; . Supported options are: * &#34;relevance desc&#34; : By relevance descending, as determined by the API algorithms. Relevance thresholding of query results is only available with this ordering. * &#34;posting_publish_time desc&#34; : By Job.posting_publish_time descending. * &#34;posting_update_time desc&#34; : By Job.posting_update_time descending. * &#34;title&#34; : By Job.title ascending. * &#34;title desc&#34; : By Job.title descending. * &#34;annualized_base_compensation&#34; : By job's CompensationInfo.annualized_base_compensation_range ascending. Jobs whose annualized base compensation is unspecified are put at the end of search results. * &#34;annualized_base_compensation desc&#34; : By job's CompensationInfo.annualized_base_compensation_range descending. Jobs whose annualized base compensation is unspecified are put at the end of search results. * &#34;annualized_total_compensation&#34; : By job's CompensationInfo.annualized_total_compensation_range ascending. Jobs whose annualized base compensation is unspecified are put at the end of search results. * &#34;annualized_total_compensation desc&#34; : By job's CompensationInfo.annualized_total_compensation_range descending. Jobs whose annualized base compensation is unspecified are put at the end of search results. * &#34;custom_ranking desc&#34; : By the relevance score adjusted to the SearchJobsRequest.CustomRankingInfo.ranking_expression with weight factor assigned by SearchJobsRequest.CustomRankingInfo.importance_level in descending order. * Location sorting: Use the special syntax to order jobs by distance: &#34;distance_from(&#39;Hawaii&#39;)&#34; : Order by distance from Hawaii. &#34;distance_from(19.89, 155.5)&#34; : Order by distance from a coordinate. &#34;distance_from(&#39;Hawaii&#39;), distance_from(&#39;Puerto Rico&#39;)&#34; : Order by multiple locations. See details below. &#34;distance_from(&#39;Hawaii&#39;), distance_from(19.89, 155.5)&#34; : Order by multiple locations. See details below. The string can have a maximum of 256 characters. When multiple distance centers are provided, a job that is close to any of the distance centers would have a high rank. When a job has multiple locations, the job location closest to one of the distance centers will be used. Jobs that don't have locations will be ranked at the bottom. Distance is calculated with a precision of 11.3 meters (37.4 feet). Diversification strategy is still applied unless explicitly disabled in diversification_level. page-token=sed The token specifying the current offset within search results. See SearchJobsResponse.next_page_token for an explanation of how to obtain the next set of query results. request-metadata allow-missing-ids=false Only set when any of domain, session_id and user_id isn't available for some reason. It is highly recommended not to set this field and provide accurate domain, session_id and user_id for the best service experience. device-info device-type=diam Type of the device. id=at A device-specific ID. The ID must be a unique identifier that distinguishes the device from other devices. .. domain=erat Required if allow_missing_ids is unset or false . The client-defined scope or source of the service call, which typically is the domain on which the service has been implemented and is currently being run. For example, if the service is being run by client Foo, Inc. , on job board www.foo.com and career site www.bar.com, then this field is set to \"foo.com\" for use on the job board, and \"bar.com\" for use on the career site. Note that any improvements to the model for a particular tenant site rely on this field being set correctly to a unique domain. The maximum number of allowed characters is 255. session-id=justo Required if allow_missing_ids is unset or false . A unique session identification string. A session is defined as the duration of an end user's interaction with the service over a certain period. Obfuscate this field for privacy concerns before providing it to the service. Note that any improvements to the model for a particular tenant site rely on this field being set correctly to a unique session ID. The maximum number of allowed characters is 255. user-id=ipsum Required if allow_missing_ids is unset or false . A unique user identification string, as determined by the client. To have the strongest positive impact on search quality make sure the client-level is unique. Obfuscate this field for privacy concerns before providing it to the service. Note that any improvements to the model for a particular tenant site rely on this field being set correctly to a unique user ID. The maximum number of allowed characters is 255. .. search-mode=accusam Mode of a search. Defaults to SearchMode.JOB_SEARCH. About Cursors The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. . Each additional . moves it up one additional level. E.g. ... would go three levels up. Optional Output Flags The method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default. -o out out specifies the destination to which to write the server's result to. It will be a JSON-encoded structure. The destination may be - to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes. If unset, it defaults to standard output. Optional General Properties The following properties can configure any call, and are not specific to this method. -p $-xgafv=string V1 error format. -p access-token=string OAuth access token. -p alt=string Data format for response. -p callback=string JSONP -p fields=string Selector specifying which fields to include in a partial response. -p key=string API key. Your API key identifies your project and provides you with API access, quota, and reports.

Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time. -r .custom-ranking-info importance-level=sanctus Required. Controls over how important the score of CustomRankingInfo.ranking_expression gets applied to job's final ranking position. An error is thrown if not specified. ranking-expression=nonumy Required. Controls over how job documents get ranked on top of existing relevance score (determined by API algorithm). A combination of the ranking expression and relevance score is used to determine job's final ranking position. The syntax for this expression is a subset of Google SQL syntax. Supported operators are: +, -, *, /, where the left and right side of the operator is either a numeric Job.custom_attributes key, integer/double value or an expression that can be evaluated to a number. Parenthesis are supported to adjust calculation precedence. The expression must be < 200 characters in length. The expression is considered invalid for a job if the expression references custom attributes that are not populated on the job or if the expression results in a divide by zero. If an expression is invalid for a job, that job is demoted to the end of the results. Sample ranking expression (year + 25) * 0.25 - (freshness / 0.5) .. disable-keyword-match=true This field is deprecated. Please use SearchJobsRequest.keyword_match_mode going forward. To migrate, disable_keyword_match set to false maps to KeywordMatchMode.KEYWORD_MATCH_ALL, and disable_keyword_match set to true maps to KeywordMatchMode.KEYWORD_MATCH_DISABLED. If SearchJobsRequest.keyword_match_mode is set, this field is ignored. Controls whether to disable exact keyword match on Job.title, Job.description, Job.company_display_name, Job.addresses, Job.qualifications. When disable keyword match is turned off, a keyword match returns jobs that do not match given category filters when there are matching keywords. For example, for the query \"program manager,\" a result is returned even if the job posting has the title \"software developer,\" which doesn't fall into \"program manager\" ontology, but does have \"program manager\" appearing in its description. For queries like \"cloud\" that don't contain title or location specific ontology, jobs with \"cloud\" keyword matches are returned regardless of this flag's value. Use Company.keyword_searchable_job_custom_attributes if company-specific globally matched custom field/attribute string values are needed. Enabling keyword match improves recall of subsequent search requests. Defaults to false. diversification-level=tempor Controls whether highly similar jobs are returned next to each other in the search results. Jobs are identified as highly similar based on their titles, job categories, and locations. Highly similar results are clustered so that only one representative job of the cluster is displayed to the job seeker higher up in the results, with the other jobs being displayed lower down in the results. Defaults to DiversificationLevel.SIMPLE if no value is specified. enable-broadening=true Controls whether to broaden the search when it produces sparse results. Broadened queries append results to the end of the matching results list. Defaults to false. job-query.commute-filter allow-imprecise-addresses=false If true , jobs without street level addresses may also be returned. For city level addresses, the city center is used. For state and coarser level addresses, text matching is used. If this field is set to false or isn't specified, only jobs that include street level addresses will be returned by commute search. commute-method=amet Required. The method of transportation to calculate the commute time for. departure-time hours=64 Hours of day in 24 hour format. Should be from 0 to 23.

The maximum travel time in seconds. The maximum allowed value is 3600s (one hour). Format is 123s . .. companies=sadipscing This filter specifies the company entities to search against. If a value isn't specified, jobs are searched for against all companies. If multiple values are specified, jobs are searched against the companies specified. The format is \"projects/{project_id}/tenants/{tenant_id}/companies/{company_id}\". For example, \"projects/foo/tenants/bar/companies/baz\". At most 20 company filters are allowed. Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. company-display-names=tempor This filter specifies the company Company.display_name of the jobs to search against. The company name must match the value exactly. Alternatively, the value being searched for can be wrapped in different match operators. SUBSTRING_MATCH([value]) The company name must contain a case insensitive substring match of the value. Using this function may increase latency. Sample Value: SUBSTRING_MATCH(google) MULTI_WORD_TOKEN_MATCH([value]) The value will be treated as a multi word token and the company name must contain a case insensitive match of the value. Using this function may increase latency. Sample Value: MULTI_WORD_TOKEN_MATCH(google) If a value isn't specified, jobs within the search results are associated with any company. If multiple values are specified, jobs within the search results may be associated with any of the specified companies. At most 20 company display name filters are allowed.

Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time. -r .custom-ranking-info importance-level=amet Required. Controls over how important the score of CustomRankingInfo.ranking_expression gets applied to job's final ranking position. An error is thrown if not specified. ranking-expression=erat Required. Controls over how job documents get ranked on top of existing relevance score (determined by API algorithm). A combination of the ranking expression and relevance score is used to determine job's final ranking position. The syntax for this expression is a subset of Google SQL syntax. Supported operators are: +, -, *, /, where the left and right side of the operator is either a numeric Job.custom_attributes key, integer/double value or an expression that can be evaluated to a number. Parenthesis are supported to adjust calculation precedence. The expression must be < 200 characters in length. The expression is considered invalid for a job if the expression references custom attributes that are not populated on the job or if the expression results in a divide by zero. If an expression is invalid for a job, that job is demoted to the end of the results. Sample ranking expression (year + 25) * 0.25 - (freshness / 0.5) .. disable-keyword-match=true This field is deprecated. Please use SearchJobsRequest.keyword_match_mode going forward. To migrate, disable_keyword_match set to false maps to KeywordMatchMode.KEYWORD_MATCH_ALL, and disable_keyword_match set to true maps to KeywordMatchMode.KEYWORD_MATCH_DISABLED. If SearchJobsRequest.keyword_match_mode is set, this field is ignored. Controls whether to disable exact keyword match on Job.title, Job.description, Job.company_display_name, Job.addresses, Job.qualifications. When disable keyword match is turned off, a keyword match returns jobs that do not match given category filters when there are matching keywords. For example, for the query \"program manager,\" a result is returned even if the job posting has the title \"software developer,\" which doesn't fall into \"program manager\" ontology, but does have \"program manager\" appearing in its description. For queries like \"cloud\" that don't contain title or location specific ontology, jobs with \"cloud\" keyword matches are returned regardless of this flag's value. Use Company.keyword_searchable_job_custom_attributes if company-specific globally matched custom field/attribute string values are needed. Enabling keyword match improves recall of subsequent search requests. Defaults to false. diversification-level=erat Controls whether highly similar jobs are returned next to each other in the search results. Jobs are identified as highly similar based on their titles, job categories, and locations. Highly similar results are clustered so that only one representative job of the cluster is displayed to the job seeker higher up in the results, with the other jobs being displayed lower down in the results. Defaults to DiversificationLevel.SIMPLE if no value is specified. enable-broadening=false Controls whether to broaden the search when it produces sparse results. Broadened queries append results to the end of the matching results list. Defaults to false. job-query.commute-filter allow-imprecise-addresses=true If true , jobs without street level addresses may also be returned. For city level addresses, the city center is used. For state and coarser level addresses, text matching is used. If this field is set to false or isn't specified, only jobs that include street level addresses will be returned by commute search. commute-method=lorem Required. The method of transportation to calculate the commute time for. departure-time hours=79 Hours of day in 24 hour format. Should be from 0 to 23.

The format is \"projects/{project_id}/tenants/{tenant_id}/companies/{company_id}\". For example, \"projects/foo/tenants/bar/companies/baz\". At most 20 company filters are allowed. Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. company-display-names=justo This filter specifies the company Company.display_name of the jobs to search against. The company name must match the value exactly. Alternatively, the value being searched for can be wrapped in different match operators. SUBSTRING_MATCH([value]) The company name must contain a case insensitive substring match of the value. Using this function may increase latency. Sample Value: SUBSTRING_MATCH(google) MULTI_WORD_TOKEN_MATCH([value]) The value will be treated as a multi word token and the company name must contain a case insensitive match of the value. Using this function may increase latency. Sample Value: MULTI_WORD_TOKEN_MATCH(google) If a value isn't specified, jobs within the search results are associated with any company. If multiple values are specified, jobs within the search results may be associated with any of the specified companies. At most 20 company display name filters are allowed.

For example if currencyCode is &#34;USD&#34; , then 1 unit is one US dollar. ... type=consetetur Required. Type of filter. units=gubergren Required. Specify desired base compensation entry&#39;s CompensationInfo.CompensationUnit. Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. .. custom-attribute-filter=dolor This filter specifies a structured syntax to match against the Job.custom_attributes marked as filterable . The syntax for this expression is a subset of SQL syntax. Supported operators are: = , != , &lt; , &lt;= , &gt; , and &gt;= where the left of the operator is a custom field key and the right of the operator is a number or a quoted string. You must escape backslash (\\) and quote (\\\") characters. Supported functions are LOWER([field_name]) to perform a case insensitive match and EMPTY([field_name]) to filter on the existence of a key. Boolean expressions (AND/OR/NOT) are supported up to 3 levels of nesting (for example, \"((A AND B AND C) OR NOT D) AND E\"), a maximum of 100 comparisons or functions are allowed in the expression. The expression must be < 10000 bytes in length. Sample Query: (LOWER(driving_license)=&#34;class \\&#34;a\\&#34;&#34; OR EMPTY(driving_license)) AND driving_years &gt; 10 disable-spell-check=true This flag controls the spell-check feature. If false, the service attempts to correct a misspelled query, for example, \"enginee\" is corrected to \"engineer\". Defaults to false: a spell check is performed. employment-types=amet. The employment type filter specifies the employment type of jobs to search against, such as EmploymentType.FULL_TIME. If a value isn't specified, jobs in the search results includes any employment type. If multiple values are specified, jobs in the search results include any of the specified employment types. Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. excluded-jobs=ipsum This filter specifies a list of job names to be excluded during search. At most 400 excluded job names are allowed. Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. job-categories=lorem The category filter specifies the categories of jobs to search against. See JobCategory for more information. If a value isn't specified, jobs from any category are searched against. If multiple values are specified, jobs from any of the specified categories are searched against. Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. language-codes=accusam This filter specifies the locale of jobs to search against, for example, \"en-US\". If a value isn't specified, the search results can contain jobs in any locale. Language codes should be in BCP-47 format, such as \"en-US\" or \"sr-Latn\". For more information, see Tags for Identifying Languages . At most 10 language code filters are allowed. Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. publish-time-range end-time=gubergren End of the period (exclusive). start-time=sadipscing Begin of the period (inclusive). .. query=at The query string that matches against the job title, description, and location fields. The maximum number of allowed characters is 255. query-language-code=sit The language code of query. For example, \"en-US\". This field helps to better interpret the query. If a value isn't specified, the query language code is automatically detected, which may not be accurate. Language code should be in BCP-47 format, such as \"en-US\" or \"sr-Latn\". For more information, see Tags for Identifying Languages . .. job-view=duo The desired job attributes returned for jobs in the search response. Defaults to JobView.JOB_VIEW_SMALL if no value is specified. keyword-match-mode=sit Controls what keyword match options to use. If both keyword_match_mode and disable_keyword_match are set, keyword_match_mode will take precedence. Defaults to KeywordMatchMode.KEYWORD_MATCH_ALL if no value is specified. max-page-size=18 A limit on the number of jobs returned in the search results. Increasing this value above the default value of 10 can increase search response time. The value can be between 1 and 100. offset=79 An integer that specifies the current offset (that is, starting result location, amongst the jobs deemed by the API as relevant) in search results. This field is only considered if page_token is unset. The maximum allowed value is 5000. Otherwise an error is thrown. For example, 0 means to return results starting from the first matching job, and 10 means to return from the 11th job. This can be used for pagination, (for example, pageSize = 10 and offset = 10 means to return from the second page). order-by=rebum. The criteria determining how search results are sorted. Default is &#34;relevance desc&#34; . Supported options are: * &#34;relevance desc&#34; : By relevance descending, as determined by the API algorithms. Relevance thresholding of query results is only available with this ordering. * &#34;posting_publish_time desc&#34; : By Job.posting_publish_time descending. * &#34;posting_update_time desc&#34; : By Job.posting_update_time descending. * &#34;title&#34; : By Job.title ascending. * &#34;title desc&#34; : By Job.title descending. * &#34;annualized_base_compensation&#34; : By job's CompensationInfo.annualized_base_compensation_range ascending. Jobs whose annualized base compensation is unspecified are put at the end of search results. * &#34;annualized_base_compensation desc&#34; : By job's CompensationInfo.annualized_base_compensation_range descending. Jobs whose annualized base compensation is unspecified are put at the end of search results. * &#34;annualized_total_compensation&#34; : By job's CompensationInfo.annualized_total_compensation_range ascending. Jobs whose annualized base compensation is unspecified are put at the end of search results. * &#34;annualized_total_compensation desc&#34; : By job's CompensationInfo.annualized_total_compensation_range descending. Jobs whose annualized base compensation is unspecified are put at the end of search results. * &#34;custom_ranking desc&#34; : By the relevance score adjusted to the SearchJobsRequest.CustomRankingInfo.ranking_expression with weight factor assigned by SearchJobsRequest.CustomRankingInfo.importance_level in descending order. * Location sorting: Use the special syntax to order jobs by distance: &#34;distance_from(&#39;Hawaii&#39;)&#34; : Order by distance from Hawaii. &#34;distance_from(19.89, 155.5)&#34; : Order by distance from a coordinate. &#34;distance_from(&#39;Hawaii&#39;), distance_from(&#39;Puerto Rico&#39;)&#34; : Order by multiple locations. See details below. &#34;distance_from(&#39;Hawaii&#39;), distance_from(19.89, 155.5)&#34; : Order by multiple locations. See details below. The string can have a maximum of 256 characters. When multiple distance centers are provided, a job that is close to any of the distance centers would have a high rank. When a job has multiple locations, the job location closest to one of the distance centers will be used. Jobs that don't have locations will be ranked at the bottom. Distance is calculated with a precision of 11.3 meters (37.4 feet). Diversification strategy is still applied unless explicitly disabled in diversification_level. page-token=dolor The token specifying the current offset within search results. See SearchJobsResponse.next_page_token for an explanation of how to obtain the next set of query results. request-metadata allow-missing-ids=false Only set when any of domain, session_id and user_id isn't available for some reason. It is highly recommended not to set this field and provide accurate domain, session_id and user_id for the best service experience. device-info device-type=amet. Type of the device. id=no A device-specific ID. The ID must be a unique identifier that distinguishes the device from other devices. .. domain=nonumy Required if allow_missing_ids is unset or false . The client-defined scope or source of the service call, which typically is the domain on which the service has been implemented and is currently being run. For example, if the service is being run by client Foo, Inc. , on job board www.foo.com and career site www.bar.com, then this field is set to \"foo.com\" for use on the job board, and \"bar.com\" for use on the career site. Note that any improvements to the model for a particular tenant site rely on this field being set correctly to a unique domain. The maximum number of allowed characters is 255. session-id=sed Required if allow_missing_ids is unset or false . A unique session identification string. A session is defined as the duration of an end user's interaction with the service over a certain period. Obfuscate this field for privacy concerns before providing it to the service. Note that any improvements to the model for a particular tenant site rely on this field being set correctly to a unique session ID. The maximum number of allowed characters is 255. user-id=kasd Required if allow_missing_ids is unset or false . A unique user identification string, as determined by the client. To have the strongest positive impact on search quality make sure the client-level is unique. Obfuscate this field for privacy concerns before providing it to the service. Note that any improvements to the model for a particular tenant site rely on this field being set correctly to a unique user ID. The maximum number of allowed characters is 255. .. search-mode=lorem Mode of a search. Defaults to SearchMode.JOB_SEARCH. About Cursors The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. . Each additional . moves it up one additional level. E.g. ... would go three levels up. Optional Output Flags The method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default. -o out out specifies the destination to which to write the server's result to. It will be a JSON-encoded structure. The destination may be - to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes. If unset, it defaults to standard output. Optional General Properties The following properties can configure any call, and are not specific to this method. -p $-xgafv=string V1 error format. -p access-token=string OAuth access token. -p alt=string Data format for response. -p callback=string JSONP -p fields=string Selector specifying which fields to include in a partial response. -p key=string API key.

For example if currencyCode is &#34;USD&#34; , then 1 unit is one US dollar. ... type=consetetur Required. Type of filter. units=gubergren Required. Specify desired base compensation entry&#39;s CompensationInfo.CompensationUnit. Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. .. custom-attribute-filter=dolor This filter specifies a structured syntax to match against the Job.custom_attributes marked as filterable . The syntax for this expression is a subset of SQL syntax. Supported operators are: = , != , &lt; , &lt;= , &gt; , and &gt;= where the left of the operator is a custom field key and the right of the operator is a number or a quoted string. You must escape backslash (\\) and quote (\\\") characters. Supported functions are LOWER([field_name]) to perform a case insensitive match and EMPTY([field_name]) to filter on the existence of a key. Boolean expressions (AND/OR/NOT) are supported up to 3 levels of nesting (for example, \"((A AND B AND C) OR NOT D) AND E\"), a maximum of 100 comparisons or functions are allowed in the expression. The expression must be < 10000 bytes in length. Sample Query: (LOWER(driving_license)=&#34;class \\&#34;a\\&#34;&#34; OR EMPTY(driving_license)) AND driving_years &gt; 10 disable-spell-check=true This flag controls the spell-check feature. If false, the service attempts to correct a misspelled query, for example, \"enginee\" is corrected to \"engineer\". Defaults to false: a spell check is performed. employment-types=amet. The employment type filter specifies the employment type of jobs to search against, such as EmploymentType.FULL_TIME. If a value isn't specified, jobs in the search results includes any employment type. If multiple values are specified, jobs in the search results include any of the specified employment types. Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. excluded-jobs=ipsum This filter specifies a list of job names to be excluded during search. At most 400 excluded job names are allowed. Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. job-categories=lorem The category filter specifies the categories of jobs to search against. See JobCategory for more information. If a value isn't specified, jobs from any category are searched against. If multiple values are specified, jobs from any of the specified categories are searched against. Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. language-codes=accusam This filter specifies the locale of jobs to search against, for example, \"en-US\". If a value isn't specified, the search results can contain jobs in any locale. Language codes should be in BCP-47 format, such as \"en-US\" or \"sr-Latn\". For more information, see Tags for Identifying Languages . At most 10 language code filters are allowed. Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. publish-time-range end-time=gubergren End of the period (exclusive). start-time=sadipscing Begin of the period (inclusive). .. query=at The query string that matches against the job title, description, and location fields. The maximum number of allowed characters is 255. query-language-code=sit The language code of query. For example, \"en-US\". This field helps to better interpret the query. If a value isn't specified, the query language code is automatically detected, which may not be accurate. Language code should be in BCP-47 format, such as \"en-US\" or \"sr-Latn\". For more information, see Tags for Identifying Languages . .. job-view=duo The desired job attributes returned for jobs in the search response. Defaults to JobView.JOB_VIEW_SMALL if no value is specified. keyword-match-mode=sit Controls what keyword match options to use. If both keyword_match_mode and disable_keyword_match are set, keyword_match_mode will take precedence. Defaults to KeywordMatchMode.KEYWORD_MATCH_ALL if no value is specified. max-page-size=18 A limit on the number of jobs returned in the search results. Increasing this value above the default value of 10 can increase search response time. The value can be between 1 and 100. offset=79 An integer that specifies the current offset (that is, starting result location, amongst the jobs deemed by the API as relevant) in search results. This field is only considered if page_token is unset. The maximum allowed value is 5000. Otherwise an error is thrown. For example, 0 means to return results starting from the first matching job, and 10 means to return from the 11th job. This can be used for pagination, (for example, pageSize = 10 and offset = 10 means to return from the second page). order-by=rebum. The criteria determining how search results are sorted. Default is &#34;relevance desc&#34; . Supported options are: * &#34;relevance desc&#34; : By relevance descending, as determined by the API algorithms. Relevance thresholding of query results is only available with this ordering. * &#34;posting_publish_time desc&#34; : By Job.posting_publish_time descending. * &#34;posting_update_time desc&#34; : By Job.posting_update_time descending. * &#34;title&#34; : By Job.title ascending. * &#34;title desc&#34; : By Job.title descending. * &#34;annualized_base_compensation&#34; : By job's CompensationInfo.annualized_base_compensation_range ascending. Jobs whose annualized base compensation is unspecified are put at the end of search results. * &#34;annualized_base_compensation desc&#34; : By job's CompensationInfo.annualized_base_compensation_range descending. Jobs whose annualized base compensation is unspecified are put at the end of search results. * &#34;annualized_total_compensation&#34; : By job's CompensationInfo.annualized_total_compensation_range ascending. Jobs whose annualized base compensation is unspecified are put at the end of search results. * &#34;annualized_total_compensation desc&#34; : By job's CompensationInfo.annualized_total_compensation_range descending. Jobs whose annualized base compensation is unspecified are put at the end of search results. * &#34;custom_ranking desc&#34; : By the relevance score adjusted to the SearchJobsRequest.CustomRankingInfo.ranking_expression with weight factor assigned by SearchJobsRequest.CustomRankingInfo.importance_level in descending order. * Location sorting: Use the special syntax to order jobs by distance: &#34;distance_from(&#39;Hawaii&#39;)&#34; : Order by distance from Hawaii. &#34;distance_from(19.89, 155.5)&#34; : Order by distance from a coordinate. &#34;distance_from(&#39;Hawaii&#39;), distance_from(&#39;Puerto Rico&#39;)&#34; : Order by multiple locations. See details below. &#34;distance_from(&#39;Hawaii&#39;), distance_from(19.89, 155.5)&#34; : Order by multiple locations. See details below. The string can have a maximum of 256 characters. When multiple distance centers are provided, a job that is close to any of the distance centers would have a high rank. When a job has multiple locations, the job location closest to one of the distance centers will be used. Jobs that don't have locations will be ranked at the bottom. Distance is calculated with a precision of 11.3 meters (37.4 feet). Diversification strategy is still applied unless explicitly disabled in diversification_level. page-token=dolor The token specifying the current offset within search results. See SearchJobsResponse.next_page_token for an explanation of how to obtain the next set of query results. request-metadata allow-missing-ids=false Only set when any of domain, session_id and user_id isn't available for some reason. It is highly recommended not to set this field and provide accurate domain, session_id and user_id for the best service experience. device-info device-type=amet. Type of the device. id=no A device-specific ID. The ID must be a unique identifier that distinguishes the device from other devices. .. domain=nonumy Required if allow_missing_ids is unset or false . The client-defined scope or source of the service call, which typically is the domain on which the service has been implemented and is currently being run. For example, if the service is being run by client Foo, Inc. , on job board www.foo.com and career site www.bar.com, then this field is set to \"foo.com\" for use on the job board, and \"bar.com\" for use on the career site. Note that any improvements to the model for a particular tenant site rely on this field being set correctly to a unique domain. The maximum number of allowed characters is 255. session-id=sed Required if allow_missing_ids is unset or false . A unique session identification string. A session is defined as the duration of an end user's interaction with the service over a certain period. Obfuscate this field for privacy concerns before providing it to the service. Note that any improvements to the model for a particular tenant site rely on this field being set correctly to a unique session ID. The maximum number of allowed characters is 255. user-id=kasd Required if allow_missing_ids is unset or false . A unique user identification string, as determined by the client. To have the strongest positive impact on search quality make sure the client-level is unique. Obfuscate this field for privacy concerns before providing it to the service. Note that any improvements to the model for a particular tenant site rely on this field being set correctly to a unique user ID.
