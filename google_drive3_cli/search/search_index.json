By default all output is printed to standard out, but flags can be set to direct it into a file independent of your shell's capabilities. Errors will be printed to standard error, and cause the program's exit code to be non-zero. If data-structures are requested, these will be returned as pretty-printed JSON, to be useful as input to other tools. Everything else about the drive API can be found at the official documentation site . Installation and Source Code Install the command-line interface with cargo using: cargo install google-drive3-cli Find the source code on github .

Each scope requires the user to grant this application permission to use it. If unset, it defaults to the shortest scope url for a particular method. --config-dir <folder> A directory into which we will store our persistent data. Defaults to a user-writable directory that we will create during the first invocation. [default: ~/.google-service-cli] Configuration The program will store all persistent data in the ~/.google-service-cli directory in JSON files prefixed with drive3- . You can change the directory used to store configuration with the --config-dir flag on a per-invocation basis. More information about the various kinds of persistent data are given in the following paragraphs. Authentication Most APIs require a user to authenticate any request. If this is the case, the scope determines the set of permissions granted. The granularity of these is usually no more than read-only or full-access . If not set, the system will automatically select the smallest feasible scope, e.g. when invoking a method that is read-only, it will ask only for a read-only scope. You may use the --scope flag to specify a scope directly. All applicable scopes are documented in the respective method's CLI documentation. The first time a scope is used, the user is asked for permission. Follow the instructions given by the CLI to grant permissions, or to decline. If a scope was authenticated by the user, the respective information will be stored as JSON in the configuration directory, e.g. ~/.google-service-cli/drive3-token-<scope-hash>.json . No manual management of these tokens is necessary. To revoke granted authentication, please refer to the official documentation . Application Secrets In order to allow any application to use Google services, it will need to be registered using the Google Developer Console . APIs the application may use are then enabled for it one by one. Most APIs can be used for free and have a daily quota. To allow more comfortable usage of the CLI without forcing anyone to register an own application, the CLI comes with a default application secret that is configured accordingly. This also means that heavy usage all around the world may deplete the daily quota. You can workaround this limitation by putting your own secrets file at this location: ~/.google-service-cli/drive3-secret.json , assuming that the required drive API was enabled for it. Such a secret file can be downloaded in the Google Developer Console at APIs & auth -> Credentials -> Download JSON and used as is. Learn more about how to setup Google projects and enable APIs using the official documentation . Debugging Even though the CLI does its best to provide usable error messages, sometimes it might be desirable to know what exactly led to a particular issue. This is done by allowing all client-server communication to be output to standard error as-is . The --debug flag will print errors using the Debug representation to standard error. You may consider redirecting standard error into a file for ease of use, e.g. drive3 --debug <resource> <method> [options] 2>debug.txt .","title":"Home"},{"location":"#installation-and-source-code","text":"Install the command-line interface with cargo using: cargo install google-drive3-cli Find the source code on github .","title":"Installation and Source Code"},{"location":"#usage","text":"This documentation was generated from the drive API at revision 20240227 .

The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. . Each additional . moves it up one additional level. E.g. ... would go three levels up. Optional Output Flags The method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default. -o out out specifies the destination to which to write the server's result to. It will be a JSON-encoded structure. The destination may be - to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes. If unset, it defaults to standard output.

The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. . Each additional . moves it up one additional level. E.g. ... would go three levels up. Required Upload Flags This method supports the upload of data, which requires all of the following flags to be set: -u simple simple - Upload media all at once. -f file Path to file to upload.

The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. . Each additional . moves it up one additional level. E.g. ... would go three levels up.

Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time. -r .background-image-file id=sed The ID of an image file in Drive to use for the background image. width=0.1291169481914689 The width of the cropped image in the closed range of 0 to 1. This value represents the width of the cropped image divided by the width of the entire image. The height is computed by applying a width to height aspect ratio of 80 to 9. The resulting image must be at least 1280 pixels wide and 144 pixels high. x-coordinate=0.745954247420243 The X coordinate of the upper left corner of the cropping area in the background image. This is a value in the closed range of 0 to 1. This value represents the horizontal distance from the left side of the entire image to the left side of the cropping area divided by the width of the entire image. y-coordinate=0.43871875610541533 The Y coordinate of the upper left corner of the cropping area in the background image. This is a value in the closed range of 0 to 1. This value represents the vertical distance from the top side of the entire image to the top side of the cropping area divided by the height of the entire image. .. background-image-link=et A short-lived link to this Team Drive's background image. capabilities can-add-children=false Whether the current user can add children to folders in this Team Drive. can-change-copy-requires-writer-permission-restriction=true Whether the current user can change the copyRequiresWriterPermission restriction of this Team Drive. can-change-domain-users-only-restriction=true Whether the current user can change the domainUsersOnly restriction of this Team Drive. can-change-sharing-folders-requires-organizer-permission-restriction=false Whether the current user can change the sharingFoldersRequiresOrganizerPermission restriction of this Team Drive. can-change-team-drive-background=true Whether the current user can change the background of this Team Drive. can-change-team-members-only-restriction=true Whether the current user can change the teamMembersOnly restriction of this Team Drive. can-comment=false Whether the current user can comment on files in this Team Drive. can-copy=true Whether the current user can copy files in this Team Drive. can-delete-children=false Whether the current user can delete children from folders in this Team Drive. can-delete-team-drive=true Whether the current user can delete this Team Drive.

This is a write-only field; it can only be set on requests that don't set colorRgb or backgroundImageFile . About Cursors The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. . Each additional . moves it up one additional level. E.g. ... would go three levels up. Optional Output Flags The method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default. -o out out specifies the destination to which to write the server's result to. It will be a JSON-encoded structure. The destination may be - to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes. If unset, it defaults to standard output.
