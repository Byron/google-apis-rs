A digital asset is an identifiable and addressable online entity that typically provides some service or content. Examples of assets are websites, Android apps, Twitter feeds, and Plus Pages."],["AssetlinkCheckCall","Determines whether the specified (directional) relationship exists between the specified source and target assets. The relation describes the intent of the link between the two assets as claimed by the source asset. An example for such relationships is the delegation of privileges or permissions. This command is most often used by infrastructure systems to check preconditions for an action. For example, a client may want to know if it is OK to send a web URL to a particular mobile app instead. The client can check for the relevant asset link from the website to the mobile app to decide if the operation should be allowed. A note about security: if you specify a secure asset as the source, such as an HTTPS website or an Android app, the API will ensure that any statements used to generate the response have been made in a secure way by the owner of that asset. Conversely, if the source asset is an insecure HTTP website (that is, the URL starts with `http://` instead of `https://`), the API cannot verify its statements securely, and it is not possible to ensure that the website's statements have not been altered by a third party.

The API guarantees that all statements with secure source assets, such as HTTPS websites or Android apps, have been made in a secure way by the owner of those assets, as described in the Digital Asset Links technical design specification. Specifically, you should consider that for insecure websites (that is, where the URL starts with `http://` instead of `https://`), this guarantee cannot be made. The `List` command is most useful in cases where the API client wants to know all the ways in which two assets are related, or enumerate all the relationships from a particular source asset. Example: a feature that helps users navigate to related items. When a mobile app is running on a device, the feature would make it easy to navigate to the corresponding web site or Google+ profile."],["StatementMethods","A builder providing access to all methods supported on statement resources.
