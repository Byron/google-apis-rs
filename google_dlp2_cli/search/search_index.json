By default all output is printed to standard out, but flags can be set to direct it into a file independent of your shell's capabilities. Errors will be printed to standard error, and cause the program's exit code to be non-zero. If data-structures are requested, these will be returned as pretty-printed JSON, to be useful as input to other tools. Everything else about the DLP API can be found at the official documentation site . Installation and Source Code Install the command-line interface with cargo using: cargo install google-dlp2-cli Find the source code on github .

[-o <out>] dlp2 --help Configuration: [--scope <url>]... Specify the authentication a method should be executed in. Each scope requires the user to grant this application permission to use it. If unset, it defaults to the shortest scope url for a particular method. --config-dir <folder> A directory into which we will store our persistent data. Defaults to a user-writable directory that we will create during the first invocation. [default: ~/.google-service-cli] Configuration The program will store all persistent data in the ~/.google-service-cli directory in JSON files prefixed with dlp2- . You can change the directory used to store configuration with the --config-dir flag on a per-invocation basis. More information about the various kinds of persistent data are given in the following paragraphs. Authentication Most APIs require a user to authenticate any request. If this is the case, the scope determines the set of permissions granted. The granularity of these is usually no more than read-only or full-access . If not set, the system will automatically select the smallest feasible scope, e.g. when invoking a method that is read-only, it will ask only for a read-only scope. You may use the --scope flag to specify a scope directly. All applicable scopes are documented in the respective method's CLI documentation. The first time a scope is used, the user is asked for permission. Follow the instructions given by the CLI to grant permissions, or to decline. If a scope was authenticated by the user, the respective information will be stored as JSON in the configuration directory, e.g. ~/.google-service-cli/dlp2-token-<scope-hash>.json . No manual management of these tokens is necessary. To revoke granted authentication, please refer to the official documentation . Application Secrets In order to allow any application to use Google services, it will need to be registered using the Google Developer Console . APIs the application may use are then enabled for it one by one. Most APIs can be used for free and have a daily quota. To allow more comfortable usage of the CLI without forcing anyone to register an own application, the CLI comes with a default application secret that is configured accordingly. This also means that heavy usage all around the world may deplete the daily quota. You can workaround this limitation by putting your own secrets file at this location: ~/.google-service-cli/dlp2-secret.json , assuming that the required dlp API was enabled for it. Such a secret file can be downloaded in the Google Developer Console at APIs & auth -> Credentials -> Download JSON and used as is. Learn more about how to setup Google projects and enable APIs using the official documentation . Debugging Even though the CLI does its best to provide usable error messages, sometimes it might be desirable to know what exactly led to a particular issue. This is done by allowing all client-server communication to be output to standard error as-is . The --debug flag will print errors using the Debug representation to standard error. You may consider redirecting standard error into a file for ease of use, e.g. dlp2 --debug <resource> <method> [options] 2>debug.txt .","title":"Home"},{"location":"#installation-and-source-code","text":"Install the command-line interface with cargo using: cargo install google-dlp2-cli Find the source code on github .","title":"Installation and Source Code"},{"location":"#usage","text":"This documentation was generated from the DLP API at revision 20240225 .

Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. exclude-info-types=true When true, excludes type information of the findings. This is not used for data profiling. include-quote=false When true, a contextual quote from the data that triggered a finding is included in the response; see Finding.quote. This is not used for data profiling. limits max-findings-per-item=45 Max number of findings that are returned for each item scanned. When set within an InspectContentRequest, this field is ignored. This value isn't a hard limit. If the number of findings for an item reaches this limit, the inspection of that item ends gradually, not abruptly.

Only one of bytes_limit_per_file and bytes_limit_per_file_percent can be specified. This field can't be set if de-identification is requested. For certain file types, setting this field has no effect. For more information, see Limits on bytes scanned per file . file-set.regex-file-set bucket-name=erat The name of a Cloud Storage bucket. Required. exclude-regex=aliquyam A list of regular expressions matching file paths to exclude. All files in the bucket that match at least one of these regular expressions will be excluded from the scan. Regular expressions use RE2 syntax ; a guide can be found under the google/re2 repository on GitHub. Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. include-regex=amet A list of regular expressions matching file paths to include. All files in the bucket that match at least one of these regular expressions will be included in the set of files, except for those that also match an item in exclude_regex . Leaving this field empty will match all files by default (this is equivalent to including .* in the list). Regular expressions use RE2 syntax ; a guide can be found under the google/re2 repository on GitHub. Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. .. url=est The Cloud Storage url of the file(s) to scan, in the format gs:/// . Trailing wildcard in the path is allowed. If the url ends in a trailing slash, the bucket or directory represented by the url will be scanned non-recursively (content in sub-directories will not be scanned). This means that gs://mybucket/ is equivalent to gs://mybucket/* , and gs://mybucket/directory/ is equivalent to gs://mybucket/directory/* . Exactly one of url or regex_file_set must be set. .. file-types=et List of file type groups to include in the scan. If empty, all files are scanned and available data format processors are applied. In addition, the binary content of the selected files is always scanned as well. Images are scanned only as binary if the specified region does not support image inspection and no file_types were specified. Image inspection is restricted to 'global', 'us', 'asia', and 'europe'. Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. files-limit-percent=91 Limits the number of files to scan to this percentage of the input FileSet. Number of files scanned is rounded down. Must be between 0 and 100, inclusively. Both 0 and 100 means no limit.

Will be stored once in the job. 256 max length. labels=key=elitr To organize findings, these labels will be added to each finding. Label keys must be between 1 and 63 characters long and must conform to the following regular expression: [a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])? . Label values must be between 0 and 63 characters long and must conform to the regular expression ([a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?)? . No more than 10 labels can be associated with a given finding. Examples: * &#34;environment&#34; : &#34;production&#34; * &#34;pipeline&#34; : &#34;etl&#34; the value will be associated with the given key required-finding-label-keys=duo These are labels that each inspection request must include within their 'finding_labels' map. Request may contain others, but any missing one of these will be rejected. Label keys must be between 1 and 63 characters long and must conform to the following regular expression: [a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])? . No more than 10 keys can be required. Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. ..timespan-config enable-auto-population-of-timespan-config=true When the job is started by a JobTrigger we will automatically figure out a valid start_time to avoid scanning files that have not been modified since the last time the JobTrigger executed. This will be based on the time of the execution of the last run of the JobTrigger or the timespan end_time used in the last run of the JobTrigger. end-time=est Exclude files, tables, or rows newer than this value.

A status for this trigger. update-time=stet Output only. The last update timestamp of a triggeredJob. .. location-id=dolores Deprecated. This field has no effect. trigger-id=eos The trigger id can contain uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens; that is, it must match the regular expression: [a-zA-Z\\d-_]+ . The maximum length is 100 characters. Can be empty to allow the system to generate one. About Cursors The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. . Each additional . moves it up one additional level. E.g. ... would go three levels up. Optional Output Flags The method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default. -o out out specifies the destination to which to write the server's result to.

About Cursors The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. . Each additional . moves it up one additional level. E.g. ... would go three levels up.

The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. . Each additional . moves it up one additional level. E.g. ... would go three levels up.

If you set this field in an InspectContentRequest, the resulting maximum value is the value that you set or 3,000, whichever is lower. This value isn't a hard limit. If an inspection reaches this limit, the inspection ends gradually, not abruptly. Therefore, the actual number of findings that Cloud DLP returns can be multiple times higher than this value. .. min-likelihood=voluptua. Only returns findings equal to or above this threshold.

A status for this trigger. update-time=elitr Output only. The last update timestamp of a triggeredJob. .. location-id=ipsum Deprecated. This field has no effect. trigger-id=kasd The trigger id can contain uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens; that is, it must match the regular expression: [a-zA-Z\\d-_]+ . The maximum length is 100 characters. Can be empty to allow the system to generate one. About Cursors The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. . Each additional . moves it up one additional level. E.g. ... would go three levels up. Optional Output Flags The method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default. -o out out specifies the destination to which to write the server's result to.

Regular expressions use RE2 syntax ; a guide can be found under the google/re2 repository on GitHub. Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. .. url=sed The Cloud Storage url of the file(s) to scan, in the format gs:/// . Trailing wildcard in the path is allowed. If the url ends in a trailing slash, the bucket or directory represented by the url will be scanned non-recursively (content in sub-directories will not be scanned). This means that gs://mybucket/ is equivalent to gs://mybucket/* , and gs://mybucket/directory/ is equivalent to gs://mybucket/directory/* . Exactly one of url or regex_file_set must be set. .. file-types=at List of file type groups to include in the scan. If empty, all files are scanned and available data format processors are applied. In addition, the binary content of the selected files is always scanned as well.

This will be based on the time of the execution of the last run of the JobTrigger or the timespan end_time used in the last run of the JobTrigger. end-time=et Exclude files, tables, or rows newer than this value. If not set, no upper time limit is applied. start-time=et Exclude files, tables, or rows older than this value. If not set, no lower time limit is applied. timestamp-field name=dolor Name describing the field. ..... last-run-time=erat Output only. The timestamp of the last time this trigger executed. name=dolore Unique resource name for the triggeredJob, assigned by the service when the triggeredJob is created, for example projects/dlp-test-project/jobTriggers/53234423 . status=vero Required. A status for this trigger. update-time=ea Output only. The last update timestamp of a triggeredJob. .. update-mask=et Mask to control which fields get updated. About Cursors The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. . Each additional . moves it up one additional level. E.g. ... would go three levels up.

If omitted, project ID is inferred from the API call. table-id=accusam Name of the table. ...cloud-storage-options bytes-limit-per-file=elitr Max number of bytes to scan from a file. If a scanned file's size is bigger than this value then the rest of the bytes are omitted. Only one of bytes_limit_per_file and bytes_limit_per_file_percent can be specified. This field can't be set if de-identification is requested. For certain file types, setting this field has no effect. For more information, see Limits on bytes scanned per file . bytes-limit-per-file-percent=71 Max percentage of bytes to scan from a file. The rest are omitted. The number of bytes scanned is rounded down. Must be between 0 and 100, inclusively. Both 0 and 100 means no limit. Defaults to 0. Only one of bytes_limit_per_file and bytes_limit_per_file_percent can be specified. This field can't be set if de-identification is requested. For certain file types, setting this field has no effect. For more information, see Limits on bytes scanned per file . file-set.regex-file-set bucket-name=labore The name of a Cloud Storage bucket. Required. exclude-regex=et A list of regular expressions matching file paths to exclude. All files in the bucket that match at least one of these regular expressions will be excluded from the scan. Regular expressions use RE2 syntax ; a guide can be found under the google/re2 repository on GitHub. Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. include-regex=eirmod A list of regular expressions matching file paths to include. All files in the bucket that match at least one of these regular expressions will be included in the set of files, except for those that also match an item in exclude_regex . Leaving this field empty will match all files by default (this is equivalent to including .* in the list). Regular expressions use RE2 syntax ; a guide can be found under the google/re2 repository on GitHub. Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. .. url=sed The Cloud Storage url of the file(s) to scan, in the format gs:/// . Trailing wildcard in the path is allowed. If the url ends in a trailing slash, the bucket or directory represented by the url will be scanned non-recursively (content in sub-directories will not be scanned). This means that gs://mybucket/ is equivalent to gs://mybucket/* , and gs://mybucket/directory/ is equivalent to gs://mybucket/directory/* . Exactly one of url or regex_file_set must be set. .. file-types=at List of file type groups to include in the scan. If empty, all files are scanned and available data format processors are applied. In addition, the binary content of the selected files is always scanned as well. Images are scanned only as binary if the specified region does not support image inspection and no file_types were specified. Image inspection is restricted to 'global', 'us', 'asia', and 'europe'. Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. files-limit-percent=86 Limits the number of files to scan to this percentage of the input FileSet. Number of files scanned is rounded down. Must be between 0 and 100, inclusively. Both 0 and 100 means no limit.

Label keys must be between 1 and 63 characters long and must conform to the following regular expression: [a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])? . Label values must be between 0 and 63 characters long and must conform to the regular expression ([a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?)? . No more than 10 labels can be associated with a given finding. Examples: * &#34;environment&#34; : &#34;production&#34; * &#34;pipeline&#34; : &#34;etl&#34; the value will be associated with the given key required-finding-label-keys=magna These are labels that each inspection request must include within their 'finding_labels' map. Request may contain others, but any missing one of these will be rejected. Label keys must be between 1 and 63 characters long and must conform to the following regular expression: [a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])? . No more than 10 keys can be required.

For example, a structure like this: GooglePrivacyDlpV2UpdateJobTriggerRequest: job-trigger: create-time: string description: string display-name: string inspect-job: inspect-config: content-options: [string] exclude-info-types: boolean include-quote: boolean limits: max-findings-per-item: integer max-findings-per-request: integer min-likelihood: string inspect-template-name: string storage-config: big-query-options: rows-limit: string rows-limit-percent: integer sample-method: string table-reference: dataset-id: string project-id: string table-id: string cloud-storage-options: bytes-limit-per-file: string bytes-limit-per-file-percent: integer file-set: regex-file-set: bucket-name: string exclude-regex: [string] include-regex: [string] url: string file-types: [string] files-limit-percent: integer sample-method: string datastore-options: kind: name: string partition-id: namespace-id: string project-id: string hybrid-options: description: string labels: { string: string } required-finding-label-keys: [string] timespan-config: enable-auto-population-of-timespan-config: boolean end-time: string start-time: string timestamp-field: name: string last-run-time: string name: string status: string update-time: string update-mask: string can be set completely with the following arguments which are assumed to be executed in the given order. Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time. -r .job-trigger create-time=eos Output only. The creation timestamp of a triggeredJob. description=vero User provided description (max 256 chars) display-name=sanctus Display name (max 100 chars) inspect-job.inspect-config content-options=dolores Deprecated and unused. Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. exclude-info-types=true When true, excludes type information of the findings. This is not used for data profiling. include-quote=false When true, a contextual quote from the data that triggered a finding is included in the response; see Finding.quote. This is not used for data profiling. limits max-findings-per-item=8 Max number of findings that are returned for each item scanned. When set within an InspectContentRequest, this field is ignored. This value isn't a hard limit. If the number of findings for an item reaches this limit, the inspection of that item ends gradually, not abruptly. Therefore, the actual number of findings that Cloud DLP returns for the item can be multiple times higher than this value. max-findings-per-request=0 Max number of findings that are returned per request or job. If you set this field in an InspectContentRequest, the resulting maximum value is the value that you set or 3,000, whichever is lower. This value isn't a hard limit. If an inspection reaches this limit, the inspection ends gradually, not abruptly. Therefore, the actual number of findings that Cloud DLP returns can be multiple times higher than this value. .. min-likelihood=magna Only returns findings equal to or above this threshold. The default is POSSIBLE. In general, the highest likelihood setting yields the fewest findings in results and the lowest chance of a false positive. For more information, see Match likelihood . .. inspect-template-name=duo If provided, will be used as the default for all values in InspectConfig. inspect_config will be merged into the values persisted as part of the template. storage-config.big-query-options rows-limit=et Max number of rows to scan. If the table has more rows than this value, the rest of the rows are omitted. If not set, or if set to 0, all rows will be scanned. Only one of rows_limit and rows_limit_percent can be specified. Cannot be used in conjunction with TimespanConfig. rows-limit-percent=40 Max percentage of rows to scan. The rest are omitted. The number of rows scanned is rounded down. Must be between 0 and 100, inclusively. Both 0 and 100 means no limit. Defaults to 0. Only one of rows_limit and rows_limit_percent can be specified. Cannot be used in conjunction with TimespanConfig. Caution: A known issue is causing the rowsLimitPercent field to behave unexpectedly. We recommend using rowsLimit instead. sample-method=sadipscing How to sample the data. table-reference dataset-id=sit Dataset ID of the table. project-id=duo The Google Cloud Platform project ID of the project containing the table. If omitted, project ID is inferred from the API call. table-id=stet Name of the table. ...cloud-storage-options bytes-limit-per-file=diam Max number of bytes to scan from a file. If a scanned file's size is bigger than this value then the rest of the bytes are omitted. Only one of bytes_limit_per_file and bytes_limit_per_file_percent can be specified. This field can't be set if de-identification is requested. For certain file types, setting this field has no effect. For more information, see Limits on bytes scanned per file . bytes-limit-per-file-percent=28 Max percentage of bytes to scan from a file. The rest are omitted. The number of bytes scanned is rounded down. Must be between 0 and 100, inclusively. Both 0 and 100 means no limit. Defaults to 0. Only one of bytes_limit_per_file and bytes_limit_per_file_percent can be specified. This field can't be set if de-identification is requested. For certain file types, setting this field has no effect. For more information, see Limits on bytes scanned per file . file-set.regex-file-set bucket-name=dolore The name of a Cloud Storage bucket. Required. exclude-regex=eirmod A list of regular expressions matching file paths to exclude. All files in the bucket that match at least one of these regular expressions will be excluded from the scan. Regular expressions use RE2 syntax ; a guide can be found under the google/re2 repository on GitHub. Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. include-regex=lorem A list of regular expressions matching file paths to include. All files in the bucket that match at least one of these regular expressions will be included in the set of files, except for those that also match an item in exclude_regex . Leaving this field empty will match all files by default (this is equivalent to including .* in the list). Regular expressions use RE2 syntax ; a guide can be found under the google/re2 repository on GitHub. Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. .. url=ut The Cloud Storage url of the file(s) to scan, in the format gs:/// . Trailing wildcard in the path is allowed. If the url ends in a trailing slash, the bucket or directory represented by the url will be scanned non-recursively (content in sub-directories will not be scanned). This means that gs://mybucket/ is equivalent to gs://mybucket/* , and gs://mybucket/directory/ is equivalent to gs://mybucket/directory/* . Exactly one of url or regex_file_set must be set. .. file-types=est List of file type groups to include in the scan. If empty, all files are scanned and available data format processors are applied. In addition, the binary content of the selected files is always scanned as well. Images are scanned only as binary if the specified region does not support image inspection and no file_types were specified. Image inspection is restricted to 'global', 'us', 'asia', and 'europe'. Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. files-limit-percent=6 Limits the number of files to scan to this percentage of the input FileSet. Number of files scanned is rounded down. Must be between 0 and 100, inclusively. Both 0 and 100 means no limit. Defaults to 0. sample-method=sit How to sample the data. ..datastore-options.kind name=ipsum The name of the kind. ..partition-id namespace-id=amet. If not empty, the ID of the namespace to which the entities belong. project-id=et The ID of the project to which the entities belong. ...hybrid-options description=ut A short description of where the data is coming from. Will be stored once in the job. 256 max length. labels=key=et To organize findings, these labels will be added to each finding. Label keys must be between 1 and 63 characters long and must conform to the following regular expression: [a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])? . Label values must be between 0 and 63 characters long and must conform to the regular expression ([a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?)? . No more than 10 labels can be associated with a given finding. Examples: * &#34;environment&#34; : &#34;production&#34; * &#34;pipeline&#34; : &#34;etl&#34; the value will be associated with the given key required-finding-label-keys=et These are labels that each inspection request must include within their 'finding_labels' map. Request may contain others, but any missing one of these will be rejected. Label keys must be between 1 and 63 characters long and must conform to the following regular expression: [a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])? . No more than 10 keys can be required. Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. ..timespan-config enable-auto-population-of-timespan-config=true When the job is started by a JobTrigger we will automatically figure out a valid start_time to avoid scanning files that have not been modified since the last time the JobTrigger executed. This will be based on the time of the execution of the last run of the JobTrigger or the timespan end_time used in the last run of the JobTrigger. end-time=stet Exclude files, tables, or rows newer than this value. If not set, no upper time limit is applied. start-time=sadipscing Exclude files, tables, or rows older than this value. If not set, no lower time limit is applied. timestamp-field name=voluptua. Name describing the field. ..... last-run-time=et Output only. The timestamp of the last time this trigger executed. name=clita Unique resource name for the triggeredJob, assigned by the service when the triggeredJob is created, for example projects/dlp-test-project/jobTriggers/53234423 . status=sit Required. A status for this trigger. update-time=rebum. Output only. The last update timestamp of a triggeredJob. .. update-mask=sanctus Mask to control which fields get updated. About Cursors The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. . Each additional . moves it up one additional level. E.g. ... would go three levels up. Optional Output Flags The method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default. -o out out specifies the destination to which to write the server's result to. It will be a JSON-encoded structure. The destination may be - to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes. If unset, it defaults to standard output. Optional General Properties The following properties can configure any call, and are not specific to this method. -p $-xgafv=string V1 error format. -p access-token=string OAuth access token. -p alt=string Data format for response. -p callback=string JSONP -p fields=string Selector specifying which fields to include in a partial response. -p key=string API key.
