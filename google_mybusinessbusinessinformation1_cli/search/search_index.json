By default all output is printed to standard out, but flags can be set to direct it into a file independent of your shell's capabilities. Errors will be printed to standard error, and cause the program's exit code to be non-zero. If data-structures are requested, these will be returned as pretty-printed JSON, to be useful as input to other tools. Everything else about the My Business Business Information API can be found at the official documentation site . Installation and Source Code Install the command-line interface with cargo using: cargo install google-mybusinessbusinessinformation1-cli Find the source code on github .

Defaults to a user-writable directory that we will create during the first invocation. [default: ~/.google-service-cli] Configuration The program will store all persistent data in the ~/.google-service-cli directory in JSON files prefixed with mybusinessbusinessinformation1- . You can change the directory used to store configuration with the --config-dir flag on a per-invocation basis. More information about the various kinds of persistent data are given in the following paragraphs. Authentication Most APIs require a user to authenticate any request. If this is the case, the scope determines the set of permissions granted. The granularity of these is usually no more than read-only or full-access . If not set, the system will automatically select the smallest feasible scope, e.g. when invoking a method that is read-only, it will ask only for a read-only scope. You may use the --scope flag to specify a scope directly. All applicable scopes are documented in the respective method's CLI documentation. The first time a scope is used, the user is asked for permission. Follow the instructions given by the CLI to grant permissions, or to decline. If a scope was authenticated by the user, the respective information will be stored as JSON in the configuration directory, e.g. ~/.google-service-cli/mybusinessbusinessinformation1-token-<scope-hash>.json . No manual management of these tokens is necessary. To revoke granted authentication, please refer to the official documentation . Application Secrets In order to allow any application to use Google services, it will need to be registered using the Google Developer Console . APIs the application may use are then enabled for it one by one. Most APIs can be used for free and have a daily quota. To allow more comfortable usage of the CLI without forcing anyone to register an own application, the CLI comes with a default application secret that is configured accordingly. This also means that heavy usage all around the world may deplete the daily quota. You can workaround this limitation by putting your own secrets file at this location: ~/.google-service-cli/mybusinessbusinessinformation1-secret.json , assuming that the required mybusinessbusinessinformation API was enabled for it. Such a secret file can be downloaded in the Google Developer Console at APIs & auth -> Credentials -> Download JSON and used as is. Learn more about how to setup Google projects and enable APIs using the official documentation . Debugging Even though the CLI does its best to provide usable error messages, sometimes it might be desirable to know what exactly led to a particular issue. This is done by allowing all client-server communication to be output to standard error as-is . The --debug flag will print errors using the Debug representation to standard error. You may consider redirecting standard error into a file for ease of use, e.g. mybusinessbusinessinformation1 --debug <resource> <method> [options] 2>debug.txt .","title":"Home"},{"location":"#installation-and-source-code","text":"Install the command-line interface with cargo using: cargo install google-mybusinessbusinessinformation1-cli Find the source code on github .","title":"Installation and Source Code"},{"location":"#usage","text":"This documentation was generated from the My Business Business Information API at revision 20240304 .

Required Scalar Argument <parent> (string) Required. The name of the account in which to create this location. Required Request Value The request value is a data-structure with various fields. Each field may be a simple scalar or another data-structure. In the latter case it is advised to set the field-cursor to the data-structure's field to specify values more concisely. For example, a structure like this: Location: ad-words-location-extensions: ad-phone: string categories: primary-category: display-name: string name: string labels: [string] language-code: string latlng: latitude: number longitude: number metadata: can-delete: boolean can-have-business-calls: boolean can-have-food-menus: boolean can-modify-service-list: boolean can-operate-health-data: boolean can-operate-local-post: boolean can-operate-lodging-data: boolean duplicate-location: string has-google-updated: boolean has-pending-edits: boolean has-voice-of-merchant: boolean maps-uri: string new-review-uri: string place-id: string name: string open-info: can-reopen: boolean opening-date: day: integer month: integer year: integer status: string phone-numbers: additional-phones: [string] primary-phone: string profile: description: string relationship-data: parent-chain: string parent-location: place-id: string relation-type: string service-area: business-type: string region-code: string store-code: string storefront-address: address-lines: [string] administrative-area: string language-code: string locality: string organization: string postal-code: string recipients: [string] region-code: string revision: integer sorting-code: string sublocality: string title: string website-uri: string can be set completely with the following arguments which are assumed to be executed in the given order. Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time. -r .ad-words-location-extensions ad-phone=et Required. An alternate phone number to display on AdWords location extensions instead of the location's primary phone number. ..categories.primary-category display-name=magna Output only. The human-readable name of the category. This is set when reading the location. When modifying the location, category_id must be set. name=no Required. A stable ID (provided by Google) for this category. The value must be specified when modifying the category (when creating or updating a location). ... labels=ipsum Optional. A collection of free-form strings to allow you to tag your business. These labels are NOT user facing; only you can see them. Must be between 1-255 characters per label. Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. language-code=voluptua. Immutable. The language of the location. Set during creation and not updateable. latlng latitude=0.5857873539022715 The latitude in degrees. It must be in the range [-90.0, +90.0]. longitude=0.16568728368878083 The longitude in degrees. It must be in the range [-180.0, +180.0]. ..metadata can-delete=true Output only. Indicates whether the location can be deleted using the API. can-have-business-calls=true Output only. Indicates if the listing is eligible for business calls. can-have-food-menus=true Output only. Indicates if the listing is eligible for food menu. can-modify-service-list=true Output only. Indicates if the listing can modify the service list. can-operate-health-data=true Output only. Indicates whether the location can operate on Health data. can-operate-local-post=false Output only. Indicates if the listing can manage local posts. can-operate-lodging-data=true Output only. Indicates whether the location can operate on Lodging data. duplicate-location=invidunt Output only. The location resource that this location duplicates. has-google-updated=true Output only. Indicates whether the place ID associated with this location has updates that need to be updated or rejected by the client. If this boolean is set, you should call the getGoogleUpdated method to lookup information that's needs to be verified. has-pending-edits=true Output only. Indicates whether any of this Location's properties are in the edit pending state. has-voice-of-merchant=false Output only. Indicates if the listing has Voice of Merchant. If this boolean is false, you should call the locations.getVoiceOfMerchantState API to get details as to why they do not have Voice of Merchant. maps-uri=ut Output only. A link to the location on Maps. new-review-uri=gubergren Output only. A link to the page on Google Search where a customer can leave a review for the location. place-id=rebum. Output only. If this locationappears on Google Maps, this field is populated with the place ID for the location. This ID can be used in various Places APIs. This field can be set during Create calls, but not for Update. .. name=est Google identifier for this location in the form: locations/{location_id} . open-info can-reopen=true Output only. Indicates whether this business is eligible for re-open. opening-date day=51 Day of a month. Must be from 1 to 31 and valid for the year and month, or 0 to specify a year by itself or a year and month where the day isn't significant. month=94 Month of a year. Must be from 1 to 12, or 0 to specify a year without a month and day. year=39 Year of the date. Must be from 1 to 9999, or 0 to specify a date without a year. .. status=ea Required. Indicates whether or not the Location is currently open for business. All locations are open by default, unless updated to be closed. ..phone-numbers additional-phones=dolor Optional. Up to two phone numbers (mobile or landline, no fax) at which your business can be called, in addition to your primary phone number. Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. primary-phone=lorem Required. A phone number that connects to your individual business location as directly as possible. Use a local phone number instead of a central, call center helpline number whenever possible. ..profile description=eos Required. Description of the location in your own voice, not editable by anyone else. ..relationship-data parent-chain=labore The resource name of the Chain that this location is member of. How to find Chain ID parent-location place-id=sed Required. Specify the location that is on the other side of the relation by its placeID. relation-type=duo Required. The type of the relationship. ...service-area business-type=sed Required. Indicates the type of the service area business. region-code=no Immutable. CLDR region code of the country/region that this service area business is based in. See http://cldr.unicode.org/ and http://www.unicode.org/cldr/charts/30/supplemental/territory_information.html for details. Example: \"CH\" for Switzerland. This field is required for CUSTOMER_LOCATION_ONLY businesses, and is ignored otherwise. The region specified here can be different from regions for the areas that this business serves (e.g. service area businesses that provide services in regions other than the one that they are based in). If this location requires verification after creation, the address provided for verification purposes must be located within this region, and the business owner or their authorized representative must be able to receive postal mail at the provided verification address. .. store-code=stet Optional. External identifier for this location, which must be unique within a given account. This is a means of associating the location with your own records. storefront-address address-lines=kasd Unstructured address lines describing the lower levels of an address. Because values in address_lines do not have type information and may sometimes contain multiple values in a single field (e.g. \"Austin, TX\"), it is important that the line order is clear. The order of address lines should be \"envelope order\" for the country/region of the address. In places where this can vary (e.g. Japan), address_language is used to make it explicit (e.g. \"ja\" for large-to-small ordering and \"ja-Latn\" or \"en\" for small-to-large). This way, the most specific line of an address can be selected based on the language. The minimum permitted structural representation of an address consists of a region_code with all remaining information placed in the address_lines. It would be possible to format such an address very approximately without geocoding, but no semantic reasoning could be made about any of the address components until it was at least partially resolved. Creating an address only containing a region_code and address_lines, and then geocoding is the recommended way to handle completely unstructured addresses (as opposed to guessing which parts of the address should be localities or administrative areas). Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. administrative-area=et Optional. Highest administrative subdivision which is used for postal addresses of a country or region. For example, this can be a state, a province, an oblast, or a prefecture. Specifically, for Spain this is the province and not the autonomous community (e.g. \"Barcelona\" and not \"Catalonia\"). Many countries don't use an administrative area in postal addresses. E.g. in Switzerland this should be left unpopulated. language-code=sed Optional. BCP-47 language code of the contents of this address (if known). This is often the UI language of the input form or is expected to match one of the languages used in the address' country/region, or their transliterated equivalents. This can affect formatting in certain countries, but is not critical to the correctness of the data and will never affect any validation or other non-formatting related operations. If this value is not known, it should be omitted (rather than specifying a possibly incorrect default). Examples: \"zh-Hant\", \"ja\", \"ja-Latn\", \"en\". locality=et Optional. Generally refers to the city/town portion of the address. Examples: US city, IT comune, UK post town. In regions of the world where localities are not well defined or do not fit into this structure well, leave locality empty and use address_lines. organization=et Optional. The name of the organization at the address. postal-code=vero Optional. Postal code of the address. Not all countries use or require postal codes to be present, but where they are used, they may trigger additional validation with other parts of the address (e.g. state/zip validation in the U.S.A.). recipients=erat Optional. The recipient at the address. This field may, under certain circumstances, contain multiline information. For example, it might contain \"care of\" information. Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. region-code=sed Required. CLDR region code of the country/region of the address. This is never inferred and it is up to the user to ensure the value is correct. See https://cldr.unicode.org/ and https://www.unicode.org/cldr/charts/30/supplemental/territory_information.html for details. Example: \"CH\" for Switzerland. revision=81 The schema revision of the PostalAddress . This must be set to 0, which is the latest revision. All new revisions must be backward compatible with old revisions. sorting-code=dolore Optional. Additional, country-specific, sorting code. This is not used in most regions. Where it is used, the value is either a string like \"CEDEX\", optionally followed by a number (e.g. \"CEDEX 7\"), or just a number alone, representing the \"sector code\" (Jamaica), \"delivery area indicator\" (Malawi) or \"post office indicator\" (e.g. C\u00f4te d'Ivoire). sublocality=et Optional. Sublocality of the address. For example, this can be neighborhoods, boroughs, districts. .. title=voluptua. Required. Location name should reflect your business's real-world name, as used consistently on your storefront, website, and stationery, and as known to customers. Any additional information, when relevant, can be included in other fields of the resource (for example, Address , Categories ). Don't add unnecessary information to your name (for example, prefer \"Google\" over \"Google Inc. - Mountain View Corporate Headquarters\"). Don't include marketing taglines, store codes, special characters, hours or closed/open status, phone numbers, website URLs, service/product information, location/address or directions, or containment information (for example, \"Chase ATM in Duane Reade\"). website-uri=amet. Optional. A URL for this business. If possible, use a URL that represents this individual business location instead of a generic website/URL that represents all locations, or the brand. About Cursors The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. . Each additional . moves it up one additional level. E.g. ... would go three levels up. Optional Output Flags The method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default. -o out out specifies the destination to which to write the server's result to. It will be a JSON-encoded structure. The destination may be - to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes. If unset, it defaults to standard output. Optional Method Properties You may set the following properties to further configure the call. Please note that -p is followed by one or more key-value-pairs, and is called like this -p k1=v1 k2=v2 even though the listing below repeats the -p for completeness. -p request-id=string Optional. A unique request ID for the server to detect duplicated requests. We recommend using UUIDs. Max length is 50 characters. -p validate-only=boolean Optional. If true, the request is validated without actually creating the location. Optional General Properties The following properties can configure any call, and are not specific to this method. -p $-xgafv=string V1 error format. -p access-token=string OAuth access token. -p alt=string Data format for response. -p callback=string JSONP -p fields=string Selector specifying which fields to include in a partial response. -p key=string API key. Your API key identifies your project and provides you with API access, quota, and reports. Required unless you provide an OAuth 2.0 token. -p oauth-token=string OAuth 2.0 token for the current user. -p pretty-print=boolean Returns response with indentations and line breaks. -p quota-user=string Available to use for quota purposes for server-side applications. Can be any arbitrary string assigned to a user, but should not exceed 40 characters. -p upload-type=string Legacy upload protocol for media (e.g. \"media\", \"multipart\"). -p upload-protocol=string Upload protocol for media (e.g. \"raw\", \"multipart\").","title":"Locations Create"},{"location":"accounts_locations-create/#required-scalar-argument","text":"<parent> (string) Required.

Many countries don't use an administrative area in postal addresses. E.g. in Switzerland this should be left unpopulated. language-code=sed Optional. BCP-47 language code of the contents of this address (if known). This is often the UI language of the input form or is expected to match one of the languages used in the address' country/region, or their transliterated equivalents. This can affect formatting in certain countries, but is not critical to the correctness of the data and will never affect any validation or other non-formatting related operations. If this value is not known, it should be omitted (rather than specifying a possibly incorrect default). Examples: \"zh-Hant\", \"ja\", \"ja-Latn\", \"en\". locality=et Optional. Generally refers to the city/town portion of the address. Examples: US city, IT comune, UK post town. In regions of the world where localities are not well defined or do not fit into this structure well, leave locality empty and use address_lines. organization=et Optional. The name of the organization at the address. postal-code=vero Optional. Postal code of the address. Not all countries use or require postal codes to be present, but where they are used, they may trigger additional validation with other parts of the address (e.g. state/zip validation in the U.S.A.). recipients=erat Optional. The recipient at the address. This field may, under certain circumstances, contain multiline information. For example, it might contain \"care of\" information. Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. region-code=sed Required. CLDR region code of the country/region of the address. This is never inferred and it is up to the user to ensure the value is correct. See https://cldr.unicode.org/ and https://www.unicode.org/cldr/charts/30/supplemental/territory_information.html for details. Example: \"CH\" for Switzerland. revision=81 The schema revision of the PostalAddress . This must be set to 0, which is the latest revision. All new revisions must be backward compatible with old revisions. sorting-code=dolore Optional. Additional, country-specific, sorting code. This is not used in most regions. Where it is used, the value is either a string like \"CEDEX\", optionally followed by a number (e.g. \"CEDEX 7\"), or just a number alone, representing the \"sector code\" (Jamaica), \"delivery area indicator\" (Malawi) or \"post office indicator\" (e.g. C\u00f4te d'Ivoire). sublocality=et Optional. Sublocality of the address. For example, this can be neighborhoods, boroughs, districts. .. title=voluptua. Required. Location name should reflect your business's real-world name, as used consistently on your storefront, website, and stationery, and as known to customers. Any additional information, when relevant, can be included in other fields of the resource (for example, Address , Categories ). Don't add unnecessary information to your name (for example, prefer \"Google\" over \"Google Inc. - Mountain View Corporate Headquarters\"). Don't include marketing taglines, store codes, special characters, hours or closed/open status, phone numbers, website URLs, service/product information, location/address or directions, or containment information (for example, \"Chase ATM in Duane Reade\"). website-uri=amet. Optional. A URL for this business. If possible, use a URL that represents this individual business location instead of a generic website/URL that represents all locations, or the brand.","title":"Required Request Value"},{"location":"accounts_locations-create/#about-cursors","text":"The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures.

A link to the location on Maps. new-review-uri=consetetur Output only. A link to the page on Google Search where a customer can leave a review for the location. place-id=amet. Output only. If this locationappears on Google Maps, this field is populated with the place ID for the location. This ID can be used in various Places APIs. This field can be set during Create calls, but not for Update. .. name=sed Google identifier for this location in the form: locations/{location_id} . open-info can-reopen=true Output only.

The type of the relationship. ...service-area business-type=lorem Required. Indicates the type of the service area business. region-code=invidunt Immutable. CLDR region code of the country/region that this service area business is based in. See http://cldr.unicode.org/ and http://www.unicode.org/cldr/charts/30/supplemental/territory_information.html for details. Example: \"CH\" for Switzerland. This field is required for CUSTOMER_LOCATION_ONLY businesses, and is ignored otherwise. The region specified here can be different from regions for the areas that this business serves (e.g. service area businesses that provide services in regions other than the one that they are based in). If this location requires verification after creation, the address provided for verification purposes must be located within this region, and the business owner or their authorized representative must be able to receive postal mail at the provided verification address. .. store-code=no Optional. External identifier for this location, which must be unique within a given account. This is a means of associating the location with your own records. storefront-address address-lines=est Unstructured address lines describing the lower levels of an address. Because values in address_lines do not have type information and may sometimes contain multiple values in a single field (e.g. \"Austin, TX\"), it is important that the line order is clear. The order of address lines should be \"envelope order\" for the country/region of the address. In places where this can vary (e.g. Japan), address_language is used to make it explicit (e.g. \"ja\" for large-to-small ordering and \"ja-Latn\" or \"en\" for small-to-large). This way, the most specific line of an address can be selected based on the language. The minimum permitted structural representation of an address consists of a region_code with all remaining information placed in the address_lines. It would be possible to format such an address very approximately without geocoding, but no semantic reasoning could be made about any of the address components until it was at least partially resolved. Creating an address only containing a region_code and address_lines, and then geocoding is the recommended way to handle completely unstructured addresses (as opposed to guessing which parts of the address should be localities or administrative areas). Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. administrative-area=at Optional. Highest administrative subdivision which is used for postal addresses of a country or region. For example, this can be a state, a province, an oblast, or a prefecture. Specifically, for Spain this is the province and not the autonomous community (e.g. \"Barcelona\" and not \"Catalonia\"). Many countries don't use an administrative area in postal addresses. E.g. in Switzerland this should be left unpopulated. language-code=sed Optional. BCP-47 language code of the contents of this address (if known). This is often the UI language of the input form or is expected to match one of the languages used in the address' country/region, or their transliterated equivalents. This can affect formatting in certain countries, but is not critical to the correctness of the data and will never affect any validation or other non-formatting related operations. If this value is not known, it should be omitted (rather than specifying a possibly incorrect default). Examples: \"zh-Hant\", \"ja\", \"ja-Latn\", \"en\". locality=sit Optional. Generally refers to the city/town portion of the address. Examples: US city, IT comune, UK post town. In regions of the world where localities are not well defined or do not fit into this structure well, leave locality empty and use address_lines. organization=et Optional. The name of the organization at the address. postal-code=tempor Optional. Postal code of the address. Not all countries use or require postal codes to be present, but where they are used, they may trigger additional validation with other parts of the address (e.g. state/zip validation in the U.S.A.). recipients=aliquyam Optional. The recipient at the address. This field may, under certain circumstances, contain multiline information. For example, it might contain \"care of\" information. Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. region-code=ipsum Required. CLDR region code of the country/region of the address. This is never inferred and it is up to the user to ensure the value is correct. See https://cldr.unicode.org/ and https://www.unicode.org/cldr/charts/30/supplemental/territory_information.html for details. Example: \"CH\" for Switzerland. revision=83 The schema revision of the PostalAddress . This must be set to 0, which is the latest revision. All new revisions must be backward compatible with old revisions. sorting-code=sanctus Optional. Additional, country-specific, sorting code. This is not used in most regions. Where it is used, the value is either a string like \"CEDEX\", optionally followed by a number (e.g. \"CEDEX 7\"), or just a number alone, representing the \"sector code\" (Jamaica), \"delivery area indicator\" (Malawi) or \"post office indicator\" (e.g. C\u00f4te d'Ivoire). sublocality=lorem Optional. Sublocality of the address. For example, this can be neighborhoods, boroughs, districts. .. title=est Required. Location name should reflect your business's real-world name, as used consistently on your storefront, website, and stationery, and as known to customers. Any additional information, when relevant, can be included in other fields of the resource (for example, Address , Categories ). Don't add unnecessary information to your name (for example, prefer \"Google\" over \"Google Inc. - Mountain View Corporate Headquarters\"). Don't include marketing taglines, store codes, special characters, hours or closed/open status, phone numbers, website URLs, service/product information, location/address or directions, or containment information (for example, \"Chase ATM in Duane Reade\"). website-uri=sed Optional. A URL for this business. If possible, use a URL that represents this individual business location instead of a generic website/URL that represents all locations, or the brand. .. page-size=72 The number of matches to return. The default value is 3, with a maximum of 10. Note that latency may increase if more are requested. There is no pagination. query=dolores Text query to search for. The search results from a query string will be less accurate than if providing an exact location, but can provide more inexact matches. About Cursors The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. . Each additional . moves it up one additional level. E.g. ... would go three levels up. Optional Output Flags The method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default. -o out out specifies the destination to which to write the server's result to. It will be a JSON-encoded structure. The destination may be - to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes. If unset, it defaults to standard output. Optional General Properties The following properties can configure any call, and are not specific to this method. -p $-xgafv=string V1 error format. -p access-token=string OAuth access token. -p alt=string Data format for response. -p callback=string JSONP -p fields=string Selector specifying which fields to include in a partial response. -p key=string API key.

Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time. -r .ad-words-location-extensions ad-phone=dolores Required. An alternate phone number to display on AdWords location extensions instead of the location's primary phone number. ..categories.primary-category display-name=et Output only.

Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. language-code=et Immutable. The language of the location. Set during creation and not updateable. latlng latitude=0.9478375320054573 The latitude in degrees. It must be in the range [-90.0, +90.0]. longitude=0.9036304069319014 The longitude in degrees. It must be in the range [-180.0, +180.0]. ..metadata can-delete=true Output only. Indicates whether the location can be deleted using the API. can-have-business-calls=false Output only.

If this boolean is set, you should call the getGoogleUpdated method to lookup information that's needs to be verified. has-pending-edits=false Output only. Indicates whether any of this Location's properties are in the edit pending state. has-voice-of-merchant=true Output only. Indicates if the listing has Voice of Merchant. If this boolean is false, you should call the locations.getVoiceOfMerchantState API to get details as to why they do not have Voice of Merchant. maps-uri=stet Output only. A link to the location on Maps. new-review-uri=est Output only. A link to the page on Google Search where a customer can leave a review for the location. place-id=aliquyam Output only. If this locationappears on Google Maps, this field is populated with the place ID for the location. This ID can be used in various Places APIs. This field can be set during Create calls, but not for Update. .. name=elitr Google identifier for this location in the form: locations/{location_id} . open-info can-reopen=true Output only. Indicates whether this business is eligible for re-open. opening-date day=44 Day of a month. Must be from 1 to 31 and valid for the year and month, or 0 to specify a year by itself or a year and month where the day isn't significant. month=48 Month of a year. Must be from 1 to 12, or 0 to specify a year without a month and day. year=8 Year of the date. Must be from 1 to 9999, or 0 to specify a date without a year. .. status=eos Required. Indicates whether or not the Location is currently open for business. All locations are open by default, unless updated to be closed. ..phone-numbers additional-phones=lorem Optional. Up to two phone numbers (mobile or landline, no fax) at which your business can be called, in addition to your primary phone number. Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. primary-phone=ea Required. A phone number that connects to your individual business location as directly as possible. Use a local phone number instead of a central, call center helpline number whenever possible. ..profile description=stet Required. Description of the location in your own voice, not editable by anyone else. ..relationship-data parent-chain=dolores The resource name of the Chain that this location is member of. How to find Chain ID parent-location place-id=eos Required. Specify the location that is on the other side of the relation by its placeID. relation-type=et Required. The type of the relationship. ...service-area business-type=sea Required. Indicates the type of the service area business. region-code=et Immutable. CLDR region code of the country/region that this service area business is based in. See http://cldr.unicode.org/ and http://www.unicode.org/cldr/charts/30/supplemental/territory_information.html for details. Example: \"CH\" for Switzerland. This field is required for CUSTOMER_LOCATION_ONLY businesses, and is ignored otherwise. The region specified here can be different from regions for the areas that this business serves (e.g. service area businesses that provide services in regions other than the one that they are based in). If this location requires verification after creation, the address provided for verification purposes must be located within this region, and the business owner or their authorized representative must be able to receive postal mail at the provided verification address. .. store-code=at Optional. External identifier for this location, which must be unique within a given account. This is a means of associating the location with your own records. storefront-address address-lines=dolore Unstructured address lines describing the lower levels of an address. Because values in address_lines do not have type information and may sometimes contain multiple values in a single field (e.g. \"Austin, TX\"), it is important that the line order is clear. The order of address lines should be \"envelope order\" for the country/region of the address. In places where this can vary (e.g. Japan), address_language is used to make it explicit (e.g. \"ja\" for large-to-small ordering and \"ja-Latn\" or \"en\" for small-to-large). This way, the most specific line of an address can be selected based on the language. The minimum permitted structural representation of an address consists of a region_code with all remaining information placed in the address_lines. It would be possible to format such an address very approximately without geocoding, but no semantic reasoning could be made about any of the address components until it was at least partially resolved. Creating an address only containing a region_code and address_lines, and then geocoding is the recommended way to handle completely unstructured addresses (as opposed to guessing which parts of the address should be localities or administrative areas). Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. administrative-area=eirmod Optional. Highest administrative subdivision which is used for postal addresses of a country or region. For example, this can be a state, a province, an oblast, or a prefecture. Specifically, for Spain this is the province and not the autonomous community (e.g. \"Barcelona\" and not \"Catalonia\"). Many countries don't use an administrative area in postal addresses. E.g. in Switzerland this should be left unpopulated. language-code=lorem Optional. BCP-47 language code of the contents of this address (if known). This is often the UI language of the input form or is expected to match one of the languages used in the address' country/region, or their transliterated equivalents. This can affect formatting in certain countries, but is not critical to the correctness of the data and will never affect any validation or other non-formatting related operations. If this value is not known, it should be omitted (rather than specifying a possibly incorrect default). Examples: \"zh-Hant\", \"ja\", \"ja-Latn\", \"en\". locality=accusam Optional. Generally refers to the city/town portion of the address. Examples: US city, IT comune, UK post town. In regions of the world where localities are not well defined or do not fit into this structure well, leave locality empty and use address_lines. organization=amet Optional. The name of the organization at the address. postal-code=erat Optional. Postal code of the address. Not all countries use or require postal codes to be present, but where they are used, they may trigger additional validation with other parts of the address (e.g. state/zip validation in the U.S.A.). recipients=dolores Optional. The recipient at the address. This field may, under certain circumstances, contain multiline information. For example, it might contain \"care of\" information. Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. region-code=erat Required. CLDR region code of the country/region of the address. This is never inferred and it is up to the user to ensure the value is correct. See https://cldr.unicode.org/ and https://www.unicode.org/cldr/charts/30/supplemental/territory_information.html for details. Example: \"CH\" for Switzerland. revision=28 The schema revision of the PostalAddress . This must be set to 0, which is the latest revision. All new revisions must be backward compatible with old revisions. sorting-code=sea Optional. Additional, country-specific, sorting code. This is not used in most regions. Where it is used, the value is either a string like \"CEDEX\", optionally followed by a number (e.g. \"CEDEX 7\"), or just a number alone, representing the \"sector code\" (Jamaica), \"delivery area indicator\" (Malawi) or \"post office indicator\" (e.g. C\u00f4te d'Ivoire). sublocality=takimata Optional. Sublocality of the address. For example, this can be neighborhoods, boroughs, districts. .. title=lorem Required. Location name should reflect your business's real-world name, as used consistently on your storefront, website, and stationery, and as known to customers. Any additional information, when relevant, can be included in other fields of the resource (for example, Address , Categories ). Don't add unnecessary information to your name (for example, prefer \"Google\" over \"Google Inc. - Mountain View Corporate Headquarters\"). Don't include marketing taglines, store codes, special characters, hours or closed/open status, phone numbers, website URLs, service/product information, location/address or directions, or containment information (for example, \"Chase ATM in Duane Reade\"). website-uri=et Optional. A URL for this business. If possible, use a URL that represents this individual business location instead of a generic website/URL that represents all locations, or the brand. About Cursors The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. . Each additional . moves it up one additional level. E.g. ... would go three levels up. Optional Output Flags The method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default. -o out out specifies the destination to which to write the server's result to. It will be a JSON-encoded structure. The destination may be - to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes. If unset, it defaults to standard output.

Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time. -r .ad-words-location-extensions ad-phone=dolores Required. An alternate phone number to display on AdWords location extensions instead of the location's primary phone number. ..categories.primary-category display-name=et Output only.

Set during creation and not updateable. latlng latitude=0.9478375320054573 The latitude in degrees. It must be in the range [-90.0, +90.0]. longitude=0.9036304069319014 The longitude in degrees. It must be in the range [-180.0, +180.0]. ..metadata can-delete=true Output only. Indicates whether the location can be deleted using the API. can-have-business-calls=false Output only.

Indicates if the listing can manage local posts. can-operate-lodging-data=false Output only. Indicates whether the location can operate on Lodging data. duplicate-location=amet Output only. The location resource that this location duplicates. has-google-updated=true Output only. Indicates whether the place ID associated with this location has updates that need to be updated or rejected by the client. If this boolean is set, you should call the getGoogleUpdated method to lookup information that's needs to be verified. has-pending-edits=false Output only. Indicates whether any of this Location's properties are in the edit pending state. has-voice-of-merchant=true Output only. Indicates if the listing has Voice of Merchant. If this boolean is false, you should call the locations.getVoiceOfMerchantState API to get details as to why they do not have Voice of Merchant. maps-uri=stet Output only. A link to the location on Maps. new-review-uri=est Output only. A link to the page on Google Search where a customer can leave a review for the location. place-id=aliquyam Output only. If this locationappears on Google Maps, this field is populated with the place ID for the location. This ID can be used in various Places APIs. This field can be set during Create calls, but not for Update. .. name=elitr Google identifier for this location in the form: locations/{location_id} . open-info can-reopen=true Output only. Indicates whether this business is eligible for re-open. opening-date day=44 Day of a month. Must be from 1 to 31 and valid for the year and month, or 0 to specify a year by itself or a year and month where the day isn't significant. month=48 Month of a year. Must be from 1 to 12, or 0 to specify a year without a month and day. year=8 Year of the date. Must be from 1 to 9999, or 0 to specify a date without a year. .. status=eos Required. Indicates whether or not the Location is currently open for business. All locations are open by default, unless updated to be closed. ..phone-numbers additional-phones=lorem Optional. Up to two phone numbers (mobile or landline, no fax) at which your business can be called, in addition to your primary phone number. Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. primary-phone=ea Required. A phone number that connects to your individual business location as directly as possible. Use a local phone number instead of a central, call center helpline number whenever possible. ..profile description=stet Required. Description of the location in your own voice, not editable by anyone else. ..relationship-data parent-chain=dolores The resource name of the Chain that this location is member of. How to find Chain ID parent-location place-id=eos Required. Specify the location that is on the other side of the relation by its placeID. relation-type=et Required. The type of the relationship. ...service-area business-type=sea Required. Indicates the type of the service area business. region-code=et Immutable. CLDR region code of the country/region that this service area business is based in. See http://cldr.unicode.org/ and http://www.unicode.org/cldr/charts/30/supplemental/territory_information.html for details. Example: \"CH\" for Switzerland. This field is required for CUSTOMER_LOCATION_ONLY businesses, and is ignored otherwise. The region specified here can be different from regions for the areas that this business serves (e.g. service area businesses that provide services in regions other than the one that they are based in). If this location requires verification after creation, the address provided for verification purposes must be located within this region, and the business owner or their authorized representative must be able to receive postal mail at the provided verification address. .. store-code=at Optional. External identifier for this location, which must be unique within a given account. This is a means of associating the location with your own records. storefront-address address-lines=dolore Unstructured address lines describing the lower levels of an address. Because values in address_lines do not have type information and may sometimes contain multiple values in a single field (e.g. \"Austin, TX\"), it is important that the line order is clear. The order of address lines should be \"envelope order\" for the country/region of the address. In places where this can vary (e.g. Japan), address_language is used to make it explicit (e.g. \"ja\" for large-to-small ordering and \"ja-Latn\" or \"en\" for small-to-large). This way, the most specific line of an address can be selected based on the language. The minimum permitted structural representation of an address consists of a region_code with all remaining information placed in the address_lines. It would be possible to format such an address very approximately without geocoding, but no semantic reasoning could be made about any of the address components until it was at least partially resolved. Creating an address only containing a region_code and address_lines, and then geocoding is the recommended way to handle completely unstructured addresses (as opposed to guessing which parts of the address should be localities or administrative areas). Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. administrative-area=eirmod Optional. Highest administrative subdivision which is used for postal addresses of a country or region. For example, this can be a state, a province, an oblast, or a prefecture. Specifically, for Spain this is the province and not the autonomous community (e.g. \"Barcelona\" and not \"Catalonia\"). Many countries don't use an administrative area in postal addresses. E.g. in Switzerland this should be left unpopulated. language-code=lorem Optional. BCP-47 language code of the contents of this address (if known). This is often the UI language of the input form or is expected to match one of the languages used in the address' country/region, or their transliterated equivalents. This can affect formatting in certain countries, but is not critical to the correctness of the data and will never affect any validation or other non-formatting related operations. If this value is not known, it should be omitted (rather than specifying a possibly incorrect default). Examples: \"zh-Hant\", \"ja\", \"ja-Latn\", \"en\". locality=accusam Optional. Generally refers to the city/town portion of the address. Examples: US city, IT comune, UK post town. In regions of the world where localities are not well defined or do not fit into this structure well, leave locality empty and use address_lines. organization=amet Optional. The name of the organization at the address. postal-code=erat Optional. Postal code of the address. Not all countries use or require postal codes to be present, but where they are used, they may trigger additional validation with other parts of the address (e.g. state/zip validation in the U.S.A.). recipients=dolores Optional. The recipient at the address. This field may, under certain circumstances, contain multiline information. For example, it might contain \"care of\" information. Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. region-code=erat Required. CLDR region code of the country/region of the address. This is never inferred and it is up to the user to ensure the value is correct. See https://cldr.unicode.org/ and https://www.unicode.org/cldr/charts/30/supplemental/territory_information.html for details. Example: \"CH\" for Switzerland. revision=28 The schema revision of the PostalAddress . This must be set to 0, which is the latest revision. All new revisions must be backward compatible with old revisions. sorting-code=sea Optional. Additional, country-specific, sorting code. This is not used in most regions. Where it is used, the value is either a string like \"CEDEX\", optionally followed by a number (e.g. \"CEDEX 7\"), or just a number alone, representing the \"sector code\" (Jamaica), \"delivery area indicator\" (Malawi) or \"post office indicator\" (e.g. C\u00f4te d'Ivoire). sublocality=takimata Optional. Sublocality of the address. For example, this can be neighborhoods, boroughs, districts. .. title=lorem Required. Location name should reflect your business's real-world name, as used consistently on your storefront, website, and stationery, and as known to customers. Any additional information, when relevant, can be included in other fields of the resource (for example, Address , Categories ). Don't add unnecessary information to your name (for example, prefer \"Google\" over \"Google Inc. - Mountain View Corporate Headquarters\"). Don't include marketing taglines, store codes, special characters, hours or closed/open status, phone numbers, website URLs, service/product information, location/address or directions, or containment information (for example, \"Chase ATM in Duane Reade\"). website-uri=et Optional. A URL for this business. If possible, use a URL that represents this individual business location instead of a generic website/URL that represents all locations, or the brand.","title":"Required Request Value"},{"location":"locations_patch/#about-cursors","text":"The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures.
