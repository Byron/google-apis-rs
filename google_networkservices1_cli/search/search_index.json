By default all output is printed to standard out, but flags can be set to direct it into a file independent of your shell's capabilities. Errors will be printed to standard error, and cause the program's exit code to be non-zero. If data-structures are requested, these will be returned as pretty-printed JSON, to be useful as input to other tools. Everything else about the NetworkServices API can be found at the official documentation site . Installation and Source Code Install the command-line interface with cargo using: cargo install google-networkservices1-cli Find the source code on github .

Each scope requires the user to grant this application permission to use it. If unset, it defaults to the shortest scope url for a particular method. --config-dir <folder> A directory into which we will store our persistent data. Defaults to a user-writable directory that we will create during the first invocation. [default: ~/.google-service-cli] Configuration The program will store all persistent data in the ~/.google-service-cli directory in JSON files prefixed with networkservices1- . You can change the directory used to store configuration with the --config-dir flag on a per-invocation basis. More information about the various kinds of persistent data are given in the following paragraphs. Authentication Most APIs require a user to authenticate any request. If this is the case, the scope determines the set of permissions granted. The granularity of these is usually no more than read-only or full-access . If not set, the system will automatically select the smallest feasible scope, e.g. when invoking a method that is read-only, it will ask only for a read-only scope. You may use the --scope flag to specify a scope directly. All applicable scopes are documented in the respective method's CLI documentation. The first time a scope is used, the user is asked for permission. Follow the instructions given by the CLI to grant permissions, or to decline. If a scope was authenticated by the user, the respective information will be stored as JSON in the configuration directory, e.g. ~/.google-service-cli/networkservices1-token-<scope-hash>.json . No manual management of these tokens is necessary. To revoke granted authentication, please refer to the official documentation . Application Secrets In order to allow any application to use Google services, it will need to be registered using the Google Developer Console . APIs the application may use are then enabled for it one by one. Most APIs can be used for free and have a daily quota. To allow more comfortable usage of the CLI without forcing anyone to register an own application, the CLI comes with a default application secret that is configured accordingly. This also means that heavy usage all around the world may deplete the daily quota. You can workaround this limitation by putting your own secrets file at this location: ~/.google-service-cli/networkservices1-secret.json , assuming that the required networkservices API was enabled for it. Such a secret file can be downloaded in the Google Developer Console at APIs & auth -> Credentials -> Download JSON and used as is. Learn more about how to setup Google projects and enable APIs using the official documentation . Debugging Even though the CLI does its best to provide usable error messages, sometimes it might be desirable to know what exactly led to a particular issue. This is done by allowing all client-server communication to be output to standard error as-is . The --debug flag will print errors using the Debug representation to standard error. You may consider redirecting standard error into a file for ease of use, e.g. networkservices1 --debug <resource> <method> [options] 2>debug.txt .","title":"Home"},{"location":"#installation-and-source-code","text":"Install the command-line interface with cargo using: cargo install google-networkservices1-cli Find the source code on github .","title":"Installation and Source Code"},{"location":"#usage","text":"This documentation was generated from the NetworkServices API at revision 20240224 .

Required Scalar Argument <resource> (string) REQUIRED: The resource for which the policy is being specified. See Resource names for the appropriate value for this field. Required Request Value The request value is a data-structure with various fields. Each field may be a simple scalar or another data-structure. In the latter case it is advised to set the field-cursor to the data-structure's field to specify values more concisely. For example, a structure like this: SetIamPolicyRequest: policy: etag: string version: integer update-mask: string can be set completely with the following arguments which are assumed to be executed in the given order. Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time. -r .policy etag=et etag is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help prevent simultaneous updates of a policy from overwriting each other.

Each field may be a simple scalar or another data-structure. In the latter case it is advised to set the field-cursor to the data-structure's field to specify values more concisely. For example, a structure like this: EndpointPolicy: authorization-policy: string client-tls-policy: string create-time: string description: string endpoint-matcher: metadata-label-matcher: metadata-label-match-criteria: string labels: { string: string } name: string server-tls-policy: string traffic-port-selector: ports: [string] type: string update-time: string can be set completely with the following arguments which are assumed to be executed in the given order. Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time. -r . authorization-policy=ipsum Optional. This field specifies the URL of AuthorizationPolicy resource that applies authorization policies to the inbound traffic at the matched endpoints. Refer to Authorization. If this field is not specified, authorization is disabled(no authz checks) for this endpoint. client-tls-policy=gubergren Optional. A URL referring to a ClientTlsPolicy resource. ClientTlsPolicy can be set to specify the authentication for traffic from the proxy to the actual endpoints. More specifically, it is applied to the outgoing traffic from the proxy to the endpoint. This is typically used for sidecar model where the proxy identifies itself as endpoint to the control plane, with the connection between sidecar and endpoint requiring authentication. If this field is not set, authentication is disabled(open). Applicable only when EndpointPolicyType is SIDECAR_PROXY. create-time=lorem Output only. The timestamp when the resource was created. description=gubergren Optional. A free-text description of the resource. Max length 1024 characters. endpoint-matcher.metadata-label-matcher metadata-label-match-criteria=eos Specifies how matching should be done. Supported values are: MATCH_ANY: At least one of the Labels specified in the matcher should match the metadata presented by xDS client. MATCH_ALL: The metadata presented by the xDS client should contain all of the labels specified here. The selection is determined based on the best match. For example, suppose there are three EndpointPolicy resources P1, P2 and P3 and if P1 has a the matcher as MATCH_ANY , P2 has MATCH_ALL , and P3 has MATCH_ALL . If a client with label connects, the config from P1 will be selected. If a client with label connects, the config from P2 will be selected. If a client with label connects, the config from P3 will be selected. If there is more than one best match, (for example, if a config P4 with selector exists and if a client with label connects), pick up the one with older creation time. ... labels=key=dolor Optional. Set of label tags associated with the EndpointPolicy resource. the value will be associated with the given key name=ea Required. Name of the EndpointPolicy resource. It matches pattern projects/{project}/locations/global/endpointPolicies/{endpoint_policy} . server-tls-policy=ipsum Optional. A URL referring to ServerTlsPolicy resource. ServerTlsPolicy is used to determine the authentication policy to be applied to terminate the inbound traffic at the identified backends. If this field is not set, authentication is disabled(open) for this endpoint. traffic-port-selector ports=invidunt Optional. A list of ports. Can be port numbers or port range (example, [80-90] specifies all ports from 80 to 90, including 80 and 90) or named ports or * to specify all ports. If the list is empty, all ports are selected. Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. .. type=amet Required. The type of endpoint policy. This is primarily used to validate the configuration. update-time=duo Output only. The timestamp when the resource was updated. About Cursors The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. . Each additional . moves it up one additional level. E.g. ... would go three levels up. Optional Output Flags The method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default. -o out out specifies the destination to which to write the server's result to. It will be a JSON-encoded structure. The destination may be - to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes. If unset, it defaults to standard output.

Required Request Value The request value is a data-structure with various fields. Each field may be a simple scalar or another data-structure. In the latter case it is advised to set the field-cursor to the data-structure's field to specify values more concisely. For example, a structure like this: EndpointPolicy: authorization-policy: string client-tls-policy: string create-time: string description: string endpoint-matcher: metadata-label-matcher: metadata-label-match-criteria: string labels: { string: string } name: string server-tls-policy: string traffic-port-selector: ports: [string] type: string update-time: string can be set completely with the following arguments which are assumed to be executed in the given order. Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time. -r . authorization-policy=ipsum Optional. This field specifies the URL of AuthorizationPolicy resource that applies authorization policies to the inbound traffic at the matched endpoints. Refer to Authorization. If this field is not specified, authorization is disabled(no authz checks) for this endpoint. client-tls-policy=sed Optional. A URL referring to a ClientTlsPolicy resource. ClientTlsPolicy can be set to specify the authentication for traffic from the proxy to the actual endpoints. More specifically, it is applied to the outgoing traffic from the proxy to the endpoint. This is typically used for sidecar model where the proxy identifies itself as endpoint to the control plane, with the connection between sidecar and endpoint requiring authentication. If this field is not set, authentication is disabled(open). Applicable only when EndpointPolicyType is SIDECAR_PROXY. create-time=ut Output only. The timestamp when the resource was created. description=gubergren Optional. A free-text description of the resource. Max length 1024 characters. endpoint-matcher.metadata-label-matcher metadata-label-match-criteria=rebum. Specifies how matching should be done. Supported values are: MATCH_ANY: At least one of the Labels specified in the matcher should match the metadata presented by xDS client. MATCH_ALL: The metadata presented by the xDS client should contain all of the labels specified here. The selection is determined based on the best match. For example, suppose there are three EndpointPolicy resources P1, P2 and P3 and if P1 has a the matcher as MATCH_ANY , P2 has MATCH_ALL , and P3 has MATCH_ALL . If a client with label connects, the config from P1 will be selected. If a client with label connects, the config from P2 will be selected. If a client with label connects, the config from P3 will be selected. If there is more than one best match, (for example, if a config P4 with selector exists and if a client with label connects), pick up the one with older creation time. ... labels=key=est Optional.

It matches pattern projects/{project}/locations/global/endpointPolicies/{endpoint_policy} . server-tls-policy=ipsum Optional. A URL referring to ServerTlsPolicy resource. ServerTlsPolicy is used to determine the authentication policy to be applied to terminate the inbound traffic at the identified backends. If this field is not set, authentication is disabled(open) for this endpoint. traffic-port-selector ports=est Optional. A list of ports. Can be port numbers or port range (example, [80-90] specifies all ports from 80 to 90, including 80 and 90) or named ports or * to specify all ports. If the list is empty, all ports are selected. Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. .. type=gubergren Required. The type of endpoint policy. This is primarily used to validate the configuration. update-time=ea Output only. The timestamp when the resource was updated. About Cursors The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. . Each additional . moves it up one additional level. E.g. ... would go three levels up. Optional Output Flags The method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default. -o out out specifies the destination to which to write the server's result to. It will be a JSON-encoded structure. The destination may be - to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes. If unset, it defaults to standard output.

Service hostnames with an optional port for which this route describes traffic. Format: [:] Hostname is the fully qualified domain name of a network host. This matches the RFC 1123 definition of a hostname with 2 notable exceptions: - IPs are not allowed. - A hostname may be prefixed with a wildcard label ( *. ). The wildcard label must appear by itself as the first label. Hostname can be \"precise\" which is a domain name without the terminating dot of a network host (e.g. foo.example.com ) or \"wildcard\", which is a domain name prefixed with a single wildcard label (e.g. *.example.com ). Note that as per RFC1035 and RFC1123, a label must consist of lower case alphanumeric characters or '-', and must start and end with an alphanumeric character. No other punctuation is allowed. The routes associated with a Mesh or Gateway must have unique hostnames. If you attempt to attach multiple routes with conflicting hostnames, the configuration will be rejected. For example, while it is acceptable for routes for the hostnames *.foo.bar.com and *.bar.com to be associated with the same route, it is not possible to associate two routes both with *.bar.com or both with bar.com . If a port is specified, then gRPC clients must use the channel URI with the port to match this rule (i.e. \"xds:///service:123\"), otherwise they must supply the URI without a port (i.e. \"xds:///service\").

The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. . Each additional . moves it up one additional level. E.g. ... would go three levels up. Optional Output Flags The method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default. -o out out specifies the destination to which to write the server's result to.

Each field may be a simple scalar or another data-structure. In the latter case it is advised to set the field-cursor to the data-structure's field to specify values more concisely. For example, a structure like this: HttpRoute: create-time: string description: string gateways: [string] hostnames: [string] labels: { string: string } meshes: [string] name: string self-link: string update-time: string can be set completely with the following arguments which are assumed to be executed in the given order.

Hostnames define a set of hosts that should match against the HTTP host header to select a HttpRoute to process the request. Hostname is the fully qualified domain name of a network host, as defined by RFC 1123 with the exception that: - IPs are not allowed. - A hostname may be prefixed with a wildcard label ( *. ). The wildcard label must appear by itself as the first label. Hostname can be \"precise\" which is a domain name without the terminating dot of a network host (e.g. foo.example.com ) or \"wildcard\", which is a domain name prefixed with a single wildcard label (e.g. *.example.com ). Note that as per RFC1035 and RFC1123, a label must consist of lower case alphanumeric characters or '-', and must start and end with an alphanumeric character. No other punctuation is allowed. The routes associated with a Mesh or Gateways must have unique hostnames. If you attempt to attach multiple routes with conflicting hostnames, the configuration will be rejected. For example, while it is acceptable for routes for the hostnames *.foo.bar.com and *.bar.com to be associated with the same Mesh (or Gateways under the same scope), it is not possible to associate two routes both with *.bar.com or both with bar.com .

The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. . Each additional . moves it up one additional level. E.g. ... would go three levels up. Optional Output Flags The method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default. -o out out specifies the destination to which to write the server's result to.

The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. . Each additional . moves it up one additional level.
