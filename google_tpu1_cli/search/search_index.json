By default all output is printed to standard out, but flags can be set to direct it into a file independent of your shell's capabilities. Errors will be printed to standard error, and cause the program's exit code to be non-zero. If data-structures are requested, these will be returned as pretty-printed JSON, to be useful as input to other tools. Everything else about the TPU API can be found at the official documentation site . Installation and Source Code Install the command-line interface with cargo using: cargo install google-tpu1-cli Find the source code on github .

Each scope requires the user to grant this application permission to use it. If unset, it defaults to the shortest scope url for a particular method. --config-dir <folder> A directory into which we will store our persistent data. Defaults to a user-writable directory that we will create during the first invocation. [default: ~/.google-service-cli] Configuration The program will store all persistent data in the ~/.google-service-cli directory in JSON files prefixed with tpu1- . You can change the directory used to store configuration with the --config-dir flag on a per-invocation basis. More information about the various kinds of persistent data are given in the following paragraphs. Authentication Most APIs require a user to authenticate any request. If this is the case, the scope determines the set of permissions granted. The granularity of these is usually no more than read-only or full-access . If not set, the system will automatically select the smallest feasible scope, e.g. when invoking a method that is read-only, it will ask only for a read-only scope. You may use the --scope flag to specify a scope directly. All applicable scopes are documented in the respective method's CLI documentation. The first time a scope is used, the user is asked for permission. Follow the instructions given by the CLI to grant permissions, or to decline. If a scope was authenticated by the user, the respective information will be stored as JSON in the configuration directory, e.g. ~/.google-service-cli/tpu1-token-<scope-hash>.json . No manual management of these tokens is necessary. To revoke granted authentication, please refer to the official documentation . Application Secrets In order to allow any application to use Google services, it will need to be registered using the Google Developer Console . APIs the application may use are then enabled for it one by one. Most APIs can be used for free and have a daily quota. To allow more comfortable usage of the CLI without forcing anyone to register an own application, the CLI comes with a default application secret that is configured accordingly. This also means that heavy usage all around the world may deplete the daily quota. You can workaround this limitation by putting your own secrets file at this location: ~/.google-service-cli/tpu1-secret.json , assuming that the required tpu API was enabled for it. Such a secret file can be downloaded in the Google Developer Console at APIs & auth -> Credentials -> Download JSON and used as is. Learn more about how to setup Google projects and enable APIs using the official documentation . Debugging Even though the CLI does its best to provide usable error messages, sometimes it might be desirable to know what exactly led to a particular issue. This is done by allowing all client-server communication to be output to standard error as-is . The --debug flag will print errors using the Debug representation to standard error. You may consider redirecting standard error into a file for ease of use, e.g. tpu1 --debug <resource> <method> [options] 2>debug.txt .","title":"Home"},{"location":"#installation-and-source-code","text":"Install the command-line interface with cargo using: cargo install google-tpu1-cli Find the source code on github .","title":"Installation and Source Code"},{"location":"#usage","text":"This documentation was generated from the TPU API at revision 20240222 .

You can set the scope for this method like this: tpu1 --scope <scope> projects locations-nodes-create ... Required Scalar Argument <parent> (string) Required. The parent resource name. Required Request Value The request value is a data-structure with various fields. Each field may be a simple scalar or another data-structure. In the latter case it is advised to set the field-cursor to the data-structure's field to specify values more concisely. For example, a structure like this: Node: accelerator-type: string api-version: string cidr-block: string create-time: string description: string health: string health-description: string ip-address: string labels: { string: string } name: string network: string port: string scheduling-config: preemptible: boolean reserved: boolean service-account: string state: string tensorflow-version: string use-service-networking: boolean can be set completely with the following arguments which are assumed to be executed in the given order. Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time. -r . accelerator-type=et Required. The type of hardware accelerators associated with this node. api-version=magna Output only. The API version that created this Node. cidr-block=no The CIDR block that the TPU node will use when selecting an IP address. This CIDR block must be a /29 block; the Compute Engine networks API forbids a smaller block, and using a larger block would be wasteful (a node can only consume one IP address). Errors will occur if the CIDR block has already been used for a currently existing TPU node, the CIDR block conflicts with any subnetworks in the user's provided network, or the provided network is peered with another network that is using that CIDR block. create-time=ipsum Output only. The time when the node was created. description=voluptua. The user-supplied description of the TPU. Maximum of 512 characters. health=at The health status of the TPU node. health-description=sanctus Output only. If this field is populated, it contains a description of why the TPU Node is unhealthy. ip-address=sed Output only. DEPRECATED! Use network_endpoints instead. The network address for the TPU Node as visible to Compute Engine instances. labels=key=amet. Resource labels to represent user-provided metadata. the value will be associated with the given key name=takimata Output only. Immutable. The name of the TPU network=amet. The name of a network they wish to peer the TPU node to. It must be a preexisting Compute Engine network inside of the project on which this API has been activated. If none is provided, \"default\" will be used. port=duo Output only. DEPRECATED! Use network_endpoints instead. The network port for the TPU Node as visible to Compute Engine instances. scheduling-config preemptible=true Defines whether the node is preemptible. reserved=true Whether the node is created under a reservation. .. service-account=lorem Output only. The service account used to run the tensor flow services within the node. To share resources, including Google Cloud Storage data, with the Tensorflow job running in the Node, this account must have permissions to that data. state=gubergren Output only. The current state for the TPU Node. tensorflow-version=eos Required. The version of Tensorflow running in the Node. use-service-networking=true Whether the VPC peering for the node is set up through Service Networking API. The VPC Peering should be set up before provisioning the node. If this field is set, cidr_block field should not be specified. If the network, that you want to peer the TPU Node to, is Shared VPC networks, the node must be created with this this field enabled. About Cursors The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. . Each additional . moves it up one additional level. E.g. ... would go three levels up. Optional Output Flags The method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default. -o out out specifies the destination to which to write the server's result to.
