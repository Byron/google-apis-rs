In the airline industry a fare is a price an airline charges for one-way travel between two points. A fare typically contains a carrier code, two city codes, a price, and a fare basis.

(A leg is the smallest unit of travel, in the case of a flight a takeoff immediately followed by a landing at two set points on a particular carrier with a particular flight number.)
