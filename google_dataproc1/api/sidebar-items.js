A binding binds one or more members to a single role. Members can be user accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A role is a named list of permissions; each role can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role.For some types of Google Cloud resources, a binding can also specify a condition, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to true. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both.
