By default all output is printed to standard out, but flags can be set to direct it into a file independent of your shell's capabilities. Errors will be printed to standard error, and cause the program's exit code to be non-zero. If data-structures are requested, these will be returned as pretty-printed JSON, to be useful as input to other tools. Everything else about the Dialogflow API can be found at the official documentation site . Installation and Source Code Install the command-line interface with cargo using: cargo install google-dialogflow2-cli Find the source code on github .

Each scope requires the user to grant this application permission to use it. If unset, it defaults to the shortest scope url for a particular method. --config-dir <folder> A directory into which we will store our persistent data. Defaults to a user-writable directory that we will create during the first invocation. [default: ~/.google-service-cli] Configuration The program will store all persistent data in the ~/.google-service-cli directory in JSON files prefixed with dialogflow2- . You can change the directory used to store configuration with the --config-dir flag on a per-invocation basis. More information about the various kinds of persistent data are given in the following paragraphs. Authentication Most APIs require a user to authenticate any request. If this is the case, the scope determines the set of permissions granted. The granularity of these is usually no more than read-only or full-access . If not set, the system will automatically select the smallest feasible scope, e.g. when invoking a method that is read-only, it will ask only for a read-only scope. You may use the --scope flag to specify a scope directly. All applicable scopes are documented in the respective method's CLI documentation. The first time a scope is used, the user is asked for permission. Follow the instructions given by the CLI to grant permissions, or to decline. If a scope was authenticated by the user, the respective information will be stored as JSON in the configuration directory, e.g. ~/.google-service-cli/dialogflow2-token-<scope-hash>.json . No manual management of these tokens is necessary. To revoke granted authentication, please refer to the official documentation . Application Secrets In order to allow any application to use Google services, it will need to be registered using the Google Developer Console . APIs the application may use are then enabled for it one by one. Most APIs can be used for free and have a daily quota. To allow more comfortable usage of the CLI without forcing anyone to register an own application, the CLI comes with a default application secret that is configured accordingly. This also means that heavy usage all around the world may deplete the daily quota. You can workaround this limitation by putting your own secrets file at this location: ~/.google-service-cli/dialogflow2-secret.json , assuming that the required dialogflow API was enabled for it. Such a secret file can be downloaded in the Google Developer Console at APIs & auth -> Credentials -> Download JSON and used as is. Learn more about how to setup Google projects and enable APIs using the official documentation . Debugging Even though the CLI does its best to provide usable error messages, sometimes it might be desirable to know what exactly led to a particular issue. This is done by allowing all client-server communication to be output to standard error as-is . The --debug flag will print errors using the Debug representation to standard error. You may consider redirecting standard error into a file for ease of use, e.g. dialogflow2 --debug <resource> <method> [options] 2>debug.txt .","title":"Home"},{"location":"#installation-and-source-code","text":"Install the command-line interface with cargo using: cargo install google-dialogflow2-cli Find the source code on github .","title":"Installation and Source Code"},{"location":"#usage","text":"This documentation was generated from the Dialogflow API at revision 20240227 .

If this is the case, the scope determines the set of permissions granted. The granularity of these is usually no more than read-only or full-access .

You may use the --scope flag to specify a scope directly. All applicable scopes are documented in the respective method's CLI documentation. The first time a scope is used, the user is asked for permission. Follow the instructions given by the CLI to grant permissions, or to decline. If a scope was authenticated by the user, the respective information will be stored as JSON in the configuration directory, e.g. ~/.google-service-cli/dialogflow2-token-<scope-hash>.json .

Speaking pitch, in the range [-20.0, 20.0]. 20 means increase 20 semitones from the original pitch. -20 means decrease 20 semitones from the original pitch. speaking-rate=0.4523282032393763 Optional. Speaking rate/speed, in the range [0.25, 4.0]. 1.0 is the normal native speed supported by the specific voice. 2.0 is twice as fast, and 0.5 is half as fast. If unset(0.0), defaults to the native 1.0 speed. Any other values < 0.25 or > 4.0 will return an error. voice name=diam Optional. The name of the voice. If not set, the service will choose a voice based on the other parameters such as language_code and ssml_gender. ssml-gender=no Optional. The preferred gender of the voice. If not set, the service will choose a voice based on the other parameters such as language_code and name. Note that this is only a preference, not requirement. If a voice of the appropriate gender is not available, the synthesizer should substitute a voice with a different gender rather than failing the request. .. volume-gain-db=0.012465497817154336 Optional. Volume gain (in dB) of the normal native volume supported by the specific voice, in the range [-96.0, 16.0]. If unset, or set to a value of 0.0 (dB), will play at normal native signal amplitude. A value of -6.0 (dB) will play at approximately half the amplitude of the normal native signal amplitude. A value of +6.0 (dB) will play at approximately twice the amplitude of the normal native signal amplitude. We strongly recommend not to exceed +10 (dB) as there's usually no effective increase in loudness for any value greater than that. ... output-audio-config-mask=accusam Mask for output_audio_config indicating which settings in this request-level config should override speech synthesizer settings defined at agent-level. If unspecified or empty, output_audio_config replaces the agent-level config in its entirety. query-input.audio-config audio-encoding=takimata Required. Audio encoding of the audio content to process. disable-no-speech-recognized-event=true Only used in Participants.AnalyzeContent and Participants.StreamingAnalyzeContent.

If false or unspecified, Speech doesn't return any word-level information. language-code=amet. Required. The language of the supplied audio. Dialogflow does not do translations. See Language Support for a list of the currently supported language codes. Note that queries in the same session do not necessarily need to specify the same language. model=sed Optional. Which Speech model to select for the given request. For more information, see Speech models . model-variant=takimata Which variant of the Speech model to use. opt-out-conformer-model-migration=true If true , the request will opt out for STT conformer model migration. This field will be deprecated once force migration takes place in June 2024. Please refer to Dialogflow ES Speech model migration . phrase-hints=et A list of strings containing words and phrases that the speech recognizer should recognize with higher likelihood. See the Cloud Speech documentation for more details. This field is deprecated. Please use speech_contexts instead. If you specify both phrase_hints and speech_contexts , Dialogflow will treat the phrase_hints as a single additional SpeechContext . Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. sample-rate-hertz=78 Required. Sample rate (in Hertz) of the audio content sent in the query. Refer to Cloud Speech API documentation for more details. single-utterance=false If false (default), recognition does not cease until the client closes the stream. If true , the recognizer will detect a single spoken utterance in input audio. Recognition ceases when it detects the audio's voice has stopped or paused. In this case, once a detected intent is received, the client should close the stream and start a new request with a new stream as needed. Note: This setting is relevant only for streaming methods. Note: When specified, InputAudioConfig.single_utterance takes precedence over StreamingDetectIntentRequest.single_utterance. ..event language-code=dolore Required. The language of this query.

Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time. -r . action=sed Optional. The name of the action associated with the intent. Note: The action name must not contain whitespaces. default-response-platforms=no Optional. The list of platforms for which the first responses will be copied from the messages in PLATFORM_UNSPECIFIED (i.e. default platform). Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. display-name=et Required. The name of this intent. end-interaction=false Optional. Indicates that this intent ends an interaction. Some integrations (e.g., Actions on Google or Dialogflow phone gateway) use this information to close interaction with an end user. Default is false. events=sed Optional. The collection of event names that trigger the intent. If the collection of input contexts is not empty, all of the contexts must be present in the active user session for an event to trigger this intent. Event names are limited to 150 characters. Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. input-context-names=no Optional. The list of context names required for this intent to be triggered. Format: projects//agent/sessions/-/contexts/ . Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. is-fallback=false Optional. Indicates whether this is a fallback intent. live-agent-handoff=false Optional. Indicates that a live agent should be brought in to handle the interaction with the user. In most cases, when you set this flag to true, you would also want to set end_interaction to true as well. Default is false. ml-disabled=true Optional. Indicates whether Machine Learning is disabled for the intent. Note: If ml_disabled setting is set to true, then this intent is not taken into account during inference in ML ONLY match mode. Also, auto-markup in the UI is turned off. name=aliquyam Optional. The unique identifier of this intent. Required for Intents.UpdateIntent and Intents.BatchUpdateIntents methods. Format: projects//agent/intents/ . parent-followup-intent-name=dolores Read-only after creation. The unique identifier of the parent intent in the chain of followup intents. You can set this field when creating an intent, for example with CreateIntent or BatchUpdateIntents, in order to make this intent a followup intent. It identifies the parent followup intent. Format: projects//agent/intents/ . priority=6 Optional. The priority of this intent. Higher numbers represent higher priorities. - If the supplied value is unspecified or 0, the service translates the value to 500,000, which corresponds to the Normal priority in the console. - If the supplied value is negative, the intent is ignored in runtime detect intent requests. reset-contexts=false Optional. Indicates whether to delete all contexts in the current session when this intent is matched. root-followup-intent-name=amet Output only. Read-only. The unique identifier of the root intent in the chain of followup intents. It identifies the correct followup intents chain for this intent. We populate this field only in the output. Format: projects//agent/intents/ . webhook-state=est Optional. Indicates whether webhooks are enabled for the intent. About Cursors The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. . Each additional . moves it up one additional level. E.g. ... would go three levels up. Optional Output Flags The method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default. -o out out specifies the destination to which to write the server's result to. It will be a JSON-encoded structure. The destination may be - to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes. If unset, it defaults to standard output. Optional Method Properties You may set the following properties to further configure the call. Please note that -p is followed by one or more key-value-pairs, and is called like this -p k1=v1 k2=v2 even though the listing below repeats the -p for completeness. -p intent-view=string Optional.

Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time. -r . input-audio=no The natural language speech audio to be processed. This field should be populated iff query_input is set to an input audio config. A single request can contain up to 1 minute of speech audio data. output-audio-config audio-encoding=amet. Required. Audio encoding of the synthesized audio content. sample-rate-hertz=51 The synthesis sample rate (in hertz) for this audio. If not provided, then the synthesizer will use the default sample rate based on the audio encoding. If this is different from the voice's natural sample rate, then the synthesizer will honor this request by converting to the desired sample rate (which might result in worse audio quality). synthesize-speech-config effects-profile-id=lorem Optional. An identifier which selects 'audio effects' profiles that are applied on (post synthesized) text to speech. Effects are applied on top of each other in the order they are given. Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. pitch=0.22509478715997322 Optional. Speaking pitch, in the range [-20.0, 20.0]. 20 means increase 20 semitones from the original pitch. -20 means decrease 20 semitones from the original pitch. speaking-rate=0.30527786829974657 Optional. Speaking rate/speed, in the range [0.25, 4.0]. 1.0 is the normal native speed supported by the specific voice. 2.0 is twice as fast, and 0.5 is half as fast. If unset(0.0), defaults to the native 1.0 speed. Any other values < 0.25 or > 4.0 will return an error. voice name=sadipscing Optional. The name of the voice. If not set, the service will choose a voice based on the other parameters such as language_code and ssml_gender. ssml-gender=at Optional. The preferred gender of the voice. If not set, the service will choose a voice based on the other parameters such as language_code and name. Note that this is only a preference, not requirement. If a voice of the appropriate gender is not available, the synthesizer should substitute a voice with a different gender rather than failing the request. .. volume-gain-db=0.3790569153851907 Optional. Volume gain (in dB) of the normal native volume supported by the specific voice, in the range [-96.0, 16.0]. If unset, or set to a value of 0.0 (dB), will play at normal native signal amplitude. A value of -6.0 (dB) will play at approximately half the amplitude of the normal native signal amplitude. A value of +6.0 (dB) will play at approximately twice the amplitude of the normal native signal amplitude. We strongly recommend not to exceed +10 (dB) as there's usually no effective increase in loudness for any value greater than that. ... output-audio-config-mask=duo Mask for output_audio_config indicating which settings in this request-level config should override speech synthesizer settings defined at agent-level. If unspecified or empty, output_audio_config replaces the agent-level config in its entirety. query-input.audio-config audio-encoding=sit Required. Audio encoding of the audio content to process. disable-no-speech-recognized-event=false Only used in Participants.AnalyzeContent and Participants.StreamingAnalyzeContent. If false and recognition doesn't return any result, trigger NO_SPEECH_RECOGNIZED event to Dialogflow agent. enable-automatic-punctuation=true Enable automatic punctuation option at the speech backend. enable-word-info=false If true , Dialogflow returns SpeechWordInfo in StreamingRecognitionResult with information about the recognized speech words, e.g. start and end time offsets. If false or unspecified, Speech doesn't return any word-level information. language-code=amet. Required. The language of the supplied audio. Dialogflow does not do translations. See Language Support for a list of the currently supported language codes. Note that queries in the same session do not necessarily need to specify the same language. model=no Optional. Which Speech model to select for the given request. For more information, see Speech models . model-variant=nonumy Which variant of the Speech model to use. opt-out-conformer-model-migration=true If true , the request will opt out for STT conformer model migration. This field will be deprecated once force migration takes place in June 2024. Please refer to Dialogflow ES Speech model migration . phrase-hints=kasd A list of strings containing words and phrases that the speech recognizer should recognize with higher likelihood. See the Cloud Speech documentation for more details. This field is deprecated. Please use speech_contexts instead. If you specify both phrase_hints and speech_contexts , Dialogflow will treat the phrase_hints as a single additional SpeechContext . Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. sample-rate-hertz=0 Required. Sample rate (in Hertz) of the audio content sent in the query. Refer to Cloud Speech API documentation for more details. single-utterance=true If false (default), recognition does not cease until the client closes the stream. If true , the recognizer will detect a single spoken utterance in input audio. Recognition ceases when it detects the audio's voice has stopped or paused. In this case, once a detected intent is received, the client should close the stream and start a new request with a new stream as needed. Note: This setting is relevant only for streaming methods. Note: When specified, InputAudioConfig.single_utterance takes precedence over StreamingDetectIntentRequest.single_utterance. ..event language-code=nonumy Required. The language of this query. See Language Support for a list of the currently supported language codes. Note that queries in the same session do not necessarily need to specify the same language. This field is ignored when used in the context of a WebhookResponse.followup_event_input field, because the language was already defined in the originating detect intent request. name=rebum. Required. The unique identifier of the event. ..text language-code=tempor Required. The language of this conversational query. See Language Support for a list of the currently supported language codes. Note that queries in the same session do not necessarily need to specify the same language. text=dolore Required. The UTF-8 encoded natural language text to be processed. Text length must not exceed 256 characters for virtual agent interactions. ...query-params.geo-location latitude=0.8195211335584085 The latitude in degrees. It must be in the range [-90.0, +90.0]. longitude=0.9082902847882928 The longitude in degrees. It must be in the range [-180.0, +180.0]. .. platform=dolore The platform of the virtual agent response messages. If not empty, only emits messages from this platform in the response. Valid values are the enum names of platform. reset-contexts=false Specifies whether to delete all contexts in the current session before the new ones are activated. sentiment-analysis-request-config analyze-query-text-sentiment=true Instructs the service to perform sentiment analysis on query_text . If not provided, sentiment analysis is not performed on query_text . .. time-zone=vero The time zone of this conversational query from the time zone database , e.g., America/New_York, Europe/Paris. If not provided, the time zone specified in agent settings is used. webhook-headers=key=duo This field can be used to pass HTTP headers for a webhook call. These headers will be sent to webhook along with the headers that have been configured through the Dialogflow web console. The headers defined within this field will overwrite the headers configured through the Dialogflow console if there is a conflict. Header names are case-insensitive. Google's specified headers are not allowed.

Speaking rate/speed, in the range [0.25, 4.0]. 1.0 is the normal native speed supported by the specific voice. 2.0 is twice as fast, and 0.5 is half as fast. If unset(0.0), defaults to the native 1.0 speed. Any other values < 0.25 or > 4.0 will return an error. voice name=sadipscing Optional. The name of the voice. If not set, the service will choose a voice based on the other parameters such as language_code and ssml_gender. ssml-gender=at Optional. The preferred gender of the voice. If not set, the service will choose a voice based on the other parameters such as language_code and name. Note that this is only a preference, not requirement. If a voice of the appropriate gender is not available, the synthesizer should substitute a voice with a different gender rather than failing the request. .. volume-gain-db=0.3790569153851907 Optional. Volume gain (in dB) of the normal native volume supported by the specific voice, in the range [-96.0, 16.0]. If unset, or set to a value of 0.0 (dB), will play at normal native signal amplitude. A value of -6.0 (dB) will play at approximately half the amplitude of the normal native signal amplitude. A value of +6.0 (dB) will play at approximately twice the amplitude of the normal native signal amplitude. We strongly recommend not to exceed +10 (dB) as there's usually no effective increase in loudness for any value greater than that. ... output-audio-config-mask=duo Mask for output_audio_config indicating which settings in this request-level config should override speech synthesizer settings defined at agent-level. If unspecified or empty, output_audio_config replaces the agent-level config in its entirety. query-input.audio-config audio-encoding=sit Required. Audio encoding of the audio content to process. disable-no-speech-recognized-event=false Only used in Participants.AnalyzeContent and Participants.StreamingAnalyzeContent. If false and recognition doesn't return any result, trigger NO_SPEECH_RECOGNIZED event to Dialogflow agent. enable-automatic-punctuation=true Enable automatic punctuation option at the speech backend. enable-word-info=false If true , Dialogflow returns SpeechWordInfo in StreamingRecognitionResult with information about the recognized speech words, e.g. start and end time offsets. If false or unspecified, Speech doesn't return any word-level information. language-code=amet. Required. The language of the supplied audio. Dialogflow does not do translations. See Language Support for a list of the currently supported language codes. Note that queries in the same session do not necessarily need to specify the same language. model=no Optional. Which Speech model to select for the given request. For more information, see Speech models . model-variant=nonumy Which variant of the Speech model to use. opt-out-conformer-model-migration=true If true , the request will opt out for STT conformer model migration. This field will be deprecated once force migration takes place in June 2024. Please refer to Dialogflow ES Speech model migration . phrase-hints=kasd A list of strings containing words and phrases that the speech recognizer should recognize with higher likelihood. See the Cloud Speech documentation for more details. This field is deprecated. Please use speech_contexts instead. If you specify both phrase_hints and speech_contexts , Dialogflow will treat the phrase_hints as a single additional SpeechContext . Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. sample-rate-hertz=0 Required. Sample rate (in Hertz) of the audio content sent in the query. Refer to Cloud Speech API documentation for more details. single-utterance=true If false (default), recognition does not cease until the client closes the stream. If true , the recognizer will detect a single spoken utterance in input audio. Recognition ceases when it detects the audio's voice has stopped or paused. In this case, once a detected intent is received, the client should close the stream and start a new request with a new stream as needed. Note: This setting is relevant only for streaming methods. Note: When specified, InputAudioConfig.single_utterance takes precedence over StreamingDetectIntentRequest.single_utterance. ..event language-code=nonumy Required. The language of this query. See Language Support for a list of the currently supported language codes. Note that queries in the same session do not necessarily need to specify the same language. This field is ignored when used in the context of a WebhookResponse.followup_event_input field, because the language was already defined in the originating detect intent request. name=rebum. Required. The unique identifier of the event. ..text language-code=tempor Required. The language of this conversational query. See Language Support for a list of the currently supported language codes. Note that queries in the same session do not necessarily need to specify the same language. text=dolore Required. The UTF-8 encoded natural language text to be processed. Text length must not exceed 256 characters for virtual agent interactions. ...query-params.geo-location latitude=0.8195211335584085 The latitude in degrees. It must be in the range [-90.0, +90.0]. longitude=0.9082902847882928 The longitude in degrees. It must be in the range [-180.0, +180.0]. .. platform=dolore The platform of the virtual agent response messages. If not empty, only emits messages from this platform in the response. Valid values are the enum names of platform. reset-contexts=false Specifies whether to delete all contexts in the current session before the new ones are activated. sentiment-analysis-request-config analyze-query-text-sentiment=true Instructs the service to perform sentiment analysis on query_text . If not provided, sentiment analysis is not performed on query_text . .. time-zone=vero The time zone of this conversational query from the time zone database , e.g., America/New_York, Europe/Paris. If not provided, the time zone specified in agent settings is used. webhook-headers=key=duo This field can be used to pass HTTP headers for a webhook call. These headers will be sent to webhook along with the headers that have been configured through the Dialogflow web console. The headers defined within this field will overwrite the headers configured through the Dialogflow console if there is a conflict. Header names are case-insensitive.

Which Speech model to select. Select the model best suited to your domain to get best results. If a model is not explicitly specified, then Dialogflow auto-selects a model based on other parameters in the SpeechToTextConfig and Agent settings. If enhanced speech model is enabled for the agent and an enhanced version of the specified model for the language does not exist, then the speech is recognized using the standard version of the specified model. Refer to Cloud Speech API documentation for more details. If you specify a model, the following models typically have the best performance: - phone_call (best for Agent Assist and telephony) - latest_short (best for Dialogflow non-telephony) - command_and_search Leave this field unspecified to use Agent Speech settings for model selection. speech-model-variant=consetetur The speech model used in speech to text. SPEECH_MODEL_VARIANT_UNSPECIFIED , USE_BEST_AVAILABLE will be treated as USE_ENHANCED . It can be overridden in AnalyzeContentRequest and StreamingAnalyzeContentRequest request. If enhanced model variant is specified and an enhanced version of the specified model for the language does not exist, then it would emit an error. use-timeout-based-endpointing=false Use timeout based endpointing, interpreting endpointer sensitivy as seconds of timeout value. .. time-zone=amet The time zone of this conversational profile from the time zone database , e.g., America/New_York, Europe/Paris. Defaults to America/New_York. tts-config effects-profile-id=et Optional. An identifier which selects 'audio effects' profiles that are applied on (post synthesized) text to speech. Effects are applied on top of each other in the order they are given. Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. pitch=0.5466724094477645 Optional. Speaking pitch, in the range [-20.0, 20.0]. 20 means increase 20 semitones from the original pitch. -20 means decrease 20 semitones from the original pitch. speaking-rate=0.30545790571193976 Optional. Speaking rate/speed, in the range [0.25, 4.0]. 1.0 is the normal native speed supported by the specific voice. 2.0 is twice as fast, and 0.5 is half as fast. If unset(0.0), defaults to the native 1.0 speed. Any other values < 0.25 or > 4.0 will return an error. voice name=sea Optional. The name of the voice. If not set, the service will choose a voice based on the other parameters such as language_code and ssml_gender. ssml-gender=duo Optional. The preferred gender of the voice. If not set, the service will choose a voice based on the other parameters such as language_code and name. Note that this is only a preference, not requirement. If a voice of the appropriate gender is not available, the synthesizer should substitute a voice with a different gender rather than failing the request. .. volume-gain-db=0.32140179933248514 Optional. Volume gain (in dB) of the normal native volume supported by the specific voice, in the range [-96.0, 16.0]. If unset, or set to a value of 0.0 (dB), will play at normal native signal amplitude. A value of -6.0 (dB) will play at approximately half the amplitude of the normal native signal amplitude. A value of +6.0 (dB) will play at approximately twice the amplitude of the normal native signal amplitude. We strongly recommend not to exceed +10 (dB) as there's usually no effective increase in loudness for any value greater than that. .. update-time=sadipscing Output only. Update time of the conversation profile. About Cursors The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. . Each additional . moves it up one additional level. E.g. ... would go three levels up. Optional Output Flags The method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default. -o out out specifies the destination to which to write the server's result to. It will be a JSON-encoded structure. The destination may be - to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes. If unset, it defaults to standard output.

Format: projects//locations//topics/ . .. security-settings=ut Name of the CX SecuritySettings reference for the agent. Format: projects//locations//securitySettings/ . stt-config model=voluptua. Which Speech model to select. Select the model best suited to your domain to get best results. If a model is not explicitly specified, then Dialogflow auto-selects a model based on other parameters in the SpeechToTextConfig and Agent settings. If enhanced speech model is enabled for the agent and an enhanced version of the specified model for the language does not exist, then the speech is recognized using the standard version of the specified model. Refer to Cloud Speech API documentation for more details. If you specify a model, the following models typically have the best performance: - phone_call (best for Agent Assist and telephony) - latest_short (best for Dialogflow non-telephony) - command_and_search Leave this field unspecified to use Agent Speech settings for model selection. speech-model-variant=consetetur The speech model used in speech to text. SPEECH_MODEL_VARIANT_UNSPECIFIED , USE_BEST_AVAILABLE will be treated as USE_ENHANCED . It can be overridden in AnalyzeContentRequest and StreamingAnalyzeContentRequest request. If enhanced model variant is specified and an enhanced version of the specified model for the language does not exist, then it would emit an error. use-timeout-based-endpointing=false Use timeout based endpointing, interpreting endpointer sensitivy as seconds of timeout value. .. time-zone=amet The time zone of this conversational profile from the time zone database , e.g., America/New_York, Europe/Paris. Defaults to America/New_York. tts-config effects-profile-id=et Optional. An identifier which selects 'audio effects' profiles that are applied on (post synthesized) text to speech. Effects are applied on top of each other in the order they are given. Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. pitch=0.5466724094477645 Optional. Speaking pitch, in the range [-20.0, 20.0]. 20 means increase 20 semitones from the original pitch. -20 means decrease 20 semitones from the original pitch. speaking-rate=0.30545790571193976 Optional. Speaking rate/speed, in the range [0.25, 4.0]. 1.0 is the normal native speed supported by the specific voice. 2.0 is twice as fast, and 0.5 is half as fast. If unset(0.0), defaults to the native 1.0 speed. Any other values < 0.25 or > 4.0 will return an error. voice name=sea Optional. The name of the voice. If not set, the service will choose a voice based on the other parameters such as language_code and ssml_gender. ssml-gender=duo Optional. The preferred gender of the voice. If not set, the service will choose a voice based on the other parameters such as language_code and name. Note that this is only a preference, not requirement. If a voice of the appropriate gender is not available, the synthesizer should substitute a voice with a different gender rather than failing the request. .. volume-gain-db=0.32140179933248514 Optional. Volume gain (in dB) of the normal native volume supported by the specific voice, in the range [-96.0, 16.0]. If unset, or set to a value of 0.0 (dB), will play at normal native signal amplitude. A value of -6.0 (dB) will play at approximately half the amplitude of the normal native signal amplitude. A value of +6.0 (dB) will play at approximately twice the amplitude of the normal native signal amplitude. We strongly recommend not to exceed +10 (dB) as there's usually no effective increase in loudness for any value greater than that. .. update-time=sadipscing Output only.

If not set, the service will choose a voice based on the other parameters such as language_code and ssml_gender. ssml-gender=invidunt Optional. The preferred gender of the voice. If not set, the service will choose a voice based on the other parameters such as language_code and name. Note that this is only a preference, not requirement. If a voice of the appropriate gender is not available, the synthesizer should substitute a voice with a different gender rather than failing the request. .. volume-gain-db=0.22806568296421847 Optional. Volume gain (in dB) of the normal native volume supported by the specific voice, in the range [-96.0, 16.0]. If unset, or set to a value of 0.0 (dB), will play at normal native signal amplitude. A value of -6.0 (dB) will play at approximately half the amplitude of the normal native signal amplitude. A value of +6.0 (dB) will play at approximately twice the amplitude of the normal native signal amplitude. We strongly recommend not to exceed +10 (dB) as there's usually no effective increase in loudness for any value greater than that. ... request-id=et A unique identifier for this request. Restricted to 36 ASCII characters. A random UUID is recommended. This request is only idempotent if a request_id is provided. suggestion-input answer-record=dolor Required. The ID of a suggestion selected by the human agent. The suggestion(s) were generated in a previous call to request Dialogflow assist. The format is: projects//locations//answerRecords/ where is an alphanumeric string. ..text-input language-code=erat Required. The language of this conversational query. See Language Support for a list of the currently supported language codes. Note that queries in the same session do not necessarily need to specify the same language. text=dolore Required. The UTF-8 encoded natural language text to be processed. Text length must not exceed 256 characters for virtual agent interactions. About Cursors The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. . Each additional . moves it up one additional level. E.g. ... would go three levels up. Optional Output Flags The method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default. -o out out specifies the destination to which to write the server's result to.

For example, a structure like this: GoogleCloudDialogflowV2SuggestSmartRepliesRequest: context-size: integer current-text-input: language-code: string text: string latest-message: string can be set completely with the following arguments which are assumed to be executed in the given order. Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time. -r . context-size=86 Max number of messages prior to and including [latest_message] to use as context when compiling the suggestion. By default 20 and at most 50. current-text-input language-code=rebum. Required. The language of this conversational query. See Language Support for a list of the currently supported language codes. Note that queries in the same session do not necessarily need to specify the same language. text=eirmod Required. The UTF-8 encoded natural language text to be processed. Text length must not exceed 256 characters for virtual agent interactions. .. latest-message=dolores The name of the latest conversation message to compile suggestion for. If empty, it will be the latest message of the conversation. Format: projects//locations//conversations//messages/ . About Cursors The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. . Each additional . moves it up one additional level. E.g. ... would go three levels up.

If Environment ID is not specified, we assume default 'draft' environment. If User ID is not specified, we assume default '-' user. Required Request Value The request value is a data-structure with various fields. Each field may be a simple scalar or another data-structure. In the latter case it is advised to set the field-cursor to the data-structure's field to specify values more concisely. For example, a structure like this: GoogleCloudDialogflowV2Context: lifespan-count: integer name: string can be set completely with the following arguments which are assumed to be executed in the given order. Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time. -r . lifespan-count=16 Optional. The number of conversational query requests after which the context expires. The default is 0 . If set to 0 , the context expires immediately.

If Environment ID is not specified, we assume default 'draft' environment. If User ID is not specified, we assume default '-' user. The following context names are reserved for internal use by Dialogflow. You should not use these contexts or create contexts with these names: * __system_counters__ * *_id_dialog_context * *_dialog_params_size About Cursors The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. .

In the latter case it is advised to set the field-cursor to the data-structure's field to specify values more concisely. For example, a structure like this: GoogleCloudDialogflowV2DetectIntentRequest: input-audio: string output-audio-config: audio-encoding: string sample-rate-hertz: integer synthesize-speech-config: effects-profile-id: [string] pitch: number speaking-rate: number voice: name: string ssml-gender: string volume-gain-db: number output-audio-config-mask: string query-input: audio-config: audio-encoding: string disable-no-speech-recognized-event: boolean enable-automatic-punctuation: boolean enable-word-info: boolean language-code: string model: string model-variant: string opt-out-conformer-model-migration: boolean phrase-hints: [string] sample-rate-hertz: integer single-utterance: boolean event: language-code: string name: string text: language-code: string text: string query-params: geo-location: latitude: number longitude: number platform: string reset-contexts: boolean sentiment-analysis-request-config: analyze-query-text-sentiment: boolean time-zone: string webhook-headers: { string: string } can be set completely with the following arguments which are assumed to be executed in the given order. Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time. -r . input-audio=ea The natural language speech audio to be processed. This field should be populated iff query_input is set to an input audio config. A single request can contain up to 1 minute of speech audio data. output-audio-config audio-encoding=sea Required. Audio encoding of the synthesized audio content. sample-rate-hertz=67 The synthesis sample rate (in hertz) for this audio. If not provided, then the synthesizer will use the default sample rate based on the audio encoding. If this is different from the voice's natural sample rate, then the synthesizer will honor this request by converting to the desired sample rate (which might result in worse audio quality). synthesize-speech-config effects-profile-id=dolores Optional. An identifier which selects 'audio effects' profiles that are applied on (post synthesized) text to speech. Effects are applied on top of each other in the order they are given. Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. pitch=0.10599511191550304 Optional. Speaking pitch, in the range [-20.0, 20.0]. 20 means increase 20 semitones from the original pitch. -20 means decrease 20 semitones from the original pitch. speaking-rate=0.6223860992915429 Optional. Speaking rate/speed, in the range [0.25, 4.0]. 1.0 is the normal native speed supported by the specific voice. 2.0 is twice as fast, and 0.5 is half as fast. If unset(0.0), defaults to the native 1.0 speed. Any other values < 0.25 or > 4.0 will return an error. voice name=et Optional. The name of the voice. If not set, the service will choose a voice based on the other parameters such as language_code and ssml_gender. ssml-gender=est Optional. The preferred gender of the voice. If not set, the service will choose a voice based on the other parameters such as language_code and name. Note that this is only a preference, not requirement. If a voice of the appropriate gender is not available, the synthesizer should substitute a voice with a different gender rather than failing the request. .. volume-gain-db=0.6784614280826983 Optional. Volume gain (in dB) of the normal native volume supported by the specific voice, in the range [-96.0, 16.0]. If unset, or set to a value of 0.0 (dB), will play at normal native signal amplitude. A value of -6.0 (dB) will play at approximately half the amplitude of the normal native signal amplitude. A value of +6.0 (dB) will play at approximately twice the amplitude of the normal native signal amplitude. We strongly recommend not to exceed +10 (dB) as there's usually no effective increase in loudness for any value greater than that. ... output-audio-config-mask=et Mask for output_audio_config indicating which settings in this request-level config should override speech synthesizer settings defined at agent-level. If unspecified or empty, output_audio_config replaces the agent-level config in its entirety. query-input.audio-config audio-encoding=labore Required. Audio encoding of the audio content to process. disable-no-speech-recognized-event=false Only used in Participants.AnalyzeContent and Participants.StreamingAnalyzeContent. If false and recognition doesn't return any result, trigger NO_SPEECH_RECOGNIZED event to Dialogflow agent. enable-automatic-punctuation=false Enable automatic punctuation option at the speech backend. enable-word-info=true If true , Dialogflow returns SpeechWordInfo in StreamingRecognitionResult with information about the recognized speech words, e.g. start and end time offsets. If false or unspecified, Speech doesn't return any word-level information. language-code=gubergren Required. The language of the supplied audio. Dialogflow does not do translations. See Language Support for a list of the currently supported language codes. Note that queries in the same session do not necessarily need to specify the same language. model=est Optional. Which Speech model to select for the given request. For more information, see Speech models . model-variant=rebum. Which variant of the Speech model to use. opt-out-conformer-model-migration=true If true , the request will opt out for STT conformer model migration. This field will be deprecated once force migration takes place in June 2024. Please refer to Dialogflow ES Speech model migration . phrase-hints=erat A list of strings containing words and phrases that the speech recognizer should recognize with higher likelihood. See the Cloud Speech documentation for more details. This field is deprecated. Please use speech_contexts instead. If you specify both phrase_hints and speech_contexts , Dialogflow will treat the phrase_hints as a single additional SpeechContext . Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. sample-rate-hertz=2 Required. Sample rate (in Hertz) of the audio content sent in the query. Refer to Cloud Speech API documentation for more details. single-utterance=true If false (default), recognition does not cease until the client closes the stream. If true , the recognizer will detect a single spoken utterance in input audio. Recognition ceases when it detects the audio's voice has stopped or paused. In this case, once a detected intent is received, the client should close the stream and start a new request with a new stream as needed. Note: This setting is relevant only for streaming methods. Note: When specified, InputAudioConfig.single_utterance takes precedence over StreamingDetectIntentRequest.single_utterance. ..event language-code=eirmod Required. The language of this query. See Language Support for a list of the currently supported language codes. Note that queries in the same session do not necessarily need to specify the same language. This field is ignored when used in the context of a WebhookResponse.followup_event_input field, because the language was already defined in the originating detect intent request. name=amet. Required. The unique identifier of the event. ..text language-code=takimata Required. The language of this conversational query. See Language Support for a list of the currently supported language codes. Note that queries in the same session do not necessarily need to specify the same language. text=amet. Required. The UTF-8 encoded natural language text to be processed. Text length must not exceed 256 characters for virtual agent interactions. ...query-params.geo-location latitude=0.6237467640152612 The latitude in degrees. It must be in the range [-90.0, +90.0]. longitude=0.4577859622777416 The longitude in degrees. It must be in the range [-180.0, +180.0]. .. platform=sit The platform of the virtual agent response messages. If not empty, only emits messages from this platform in the response. Valid values are the enum names of platform. reset-contexts=false Specifies whether to delete all contexts in the current session before the new ones are activated. sentiment-analysis-request-config analyze-query-text-sentiment=false Instructs the service to perform sentiment analysis on query_text . If not provided, sentiment analysis is not performed on query_text . .. time-zone=voluptua. The time zone of this conversational query from the time zone database , e.g., America/New_York, Europe/Paris. If not provided, the time zone specified in agent settings is used. webhook-headers=key=justo This field can be used to pass HTTP headers for a webhook call. These headers will be sent to webhook along with the headers that have been configured through the Dialogflow web console. The headers defined within this field will overwrite the headers configured through the Dialogflow console if there is a conflict. Header names are case-insensitive. Google's specified headers are not allowed. Including: \"Host\", \"Content-Length\", \"Connection\", \"From\", \"User-Agent\", \"Accept-Encoding\", \"If-Modified-Since\", \"If-None-Match\", \"X-Forwarded-For\", etc. the value will be associated with the given key About Cursors The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. . Each additional . moves it up one additional level. E.g. ... would go three levels up.

Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time. -r . input-audio=et The natural language speech audio to be processed. This field should be populated iff query_input is set to an input audio config. A single request can contain up to 1 minute of speech audio data. output-audio-config audio-encoding=voluptua. Required. Audio encoding of the synthesized audio content. sample-rate-hertz=51 The synthesis sample rate (in hertz) for this audio. If not provided, then the synthesizer will use the default sample rate based on the audio encoding. If this is different from the voice's natural sample rate, then the synthesizer will honor this request by converting to the desired sample rate (which might result in worse audio quality). synthesize-speech-config effects-profile-id=ea Optional. An identifier which selects 'audio effects' profiles that are applied on (post synthesized) text to speech. Effects are applied on top of each other in the order they are given. Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. pitch=0.7508283376265702 Optional. Speaking pitch, in the range [-20.0, 20.0]. 20 means increase 20 semitones from the original pitch. -20 means decrease 20 semitones from the original pitch. speaking-rate=0.5883172552329693 Optional. Speaking rate/speed, in the range [0.25, 4.0]. 1.0 is the normal native speed supported by the specific voice. 2.0 is twice as fast, and 0.5 is half as fast. If unset(0.0), defaults to the native 1.0 speed. Any other values < 0.25 or > 4.0 will return an error. voice name=dolores Optional. The name of the voice. If not set, the service will choose a voice based on the other parameters such as language_code and ssml_gender. ssml-gender=elitr Optional. The preferred gender of the voice. If not set, the service will choose a voice based on the other parameters such as language_code and name. Note that this is only a preference, not requirement. If a voice of the appropriate gender is not available, the synthesizer should substitute a voice with a different gender rather than failing the request. .. volume-gain-db=0.17681603930653433 Optional. Volume gain (in dB) of the normal native volume supported by the specific voice, in the range [-96.0, 16.0]. If unset, or set to a value of 0.0 (dB), will play at normal native signal amplitude. A value of -6.0 (dB) will play at approximately half the amplitude of the normal native signal amplitude. A value of +6.0 (dB) will play at approximately twice the amplitude of the normal native signal amplitude. We strongly recommend not to exceed +10 (dB) as there's usually no effective increase in loudness for any value greater than that. ... output-audio-config-mask=lorem Mask for output_audio_config indicating which settings in this request-level config should override speech synthesizer settings defined at agent-level. If unspecified or empty, output_audio_config replaces the agent-level config in its entirety. query-input.audio-config audio-encoding=magna Required. Audio encoding of the audio content to process. disable-no-speech-recognized-event=true Only used in Participants.AnalyzeContent and Participants.StreamingAnalyzeContent. If false and recognition doesn't return any result, trigger NO_SPEECH_RECOGNIZED event to Dialogflow agent. enable-automatic-punctuation=true Enable automatic punctuation option at the speech backend. enable-word-info=true If true , Dialogflow returns SpeechWordInfo in StreamingRecognitionResult with information about the recognized speech words, e.g. start and end time offsets. If false or unspecified, Speech doesn't return any word-level information. language-code=sit Required. The language of the supplied audio. Dialogflow does not do translations. See Language Support for a list of the currently supported language codes. Note that queries in the same session do not necessarily need to specify the same language. model=duo Optional. Which Speech model to select for the given request. For more information, see Speech models . model-variant=stet Which variant of the Speech model to use. opt-out-conformer-model-migration=false If true , the request will opt out for STT conformer model migration. This field will be deprecated once force migration takes place in June 2024. Please refer to Dialogflow ES Speech model migration . phrase-hints=dolore A list of strings containing words and phrases that the speech recognizer should recognize with higher likelihood. See the Cloud Speech documentation for more details. This field is deprecated. Please use speech_contexts instead. If you specify both phrase_hints and speech_contexts , Dialogflow will treat the phrase_hints as a single additional SpeechContext . Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. sample-rate-hertz=61 Required. Sample rate (in Hertz) of the audio content sent in the query. Refer to Cloud Speech API documentation for more details. single-utterance=true If false (default), recognition does not cease until the client closes the stream. If true , the recognizer will detect a single spoken utterance in input audio. Recognition ceases when it detects the audio's voice has stopped or paused. In this case, once a detected intent is received, the client should close the stream and start a new request with a new stream as needed. Note: This setting is relevant only for streaming methods. Note: When specified, InputAudioConfig.single_utterance takes precedence over StreamingDetectIntentRequest.single_utterance. ..event language-code=ut Required. The language of this query. See Language Support for a list of the currently supported language codes. Note that queries in the same session do not necessarily need to specify the same language. This field is ignored when used in the context of a WebhookResponse.followup_event_input field, because the language was already defined in the originating detect intent request. name=est Required. The unique identifier of the event. ..text language-code=sadipscing Required. The language of this conversational query. See Language Support for a list of the currently supported language codes.

Valid values are the enum names of platform. reset-contexts=true Specifies whether to delete all contexts in the current session before the new ones are activated. sentiment-analysis-request-config analyze-query-text-sentiment=true Instructs the service to perform sentiment analysis on query_text . If not provided, sentiment analysis is not performed on query_text . .. time-zone=stet The time zone of this conversational query from the time zone database , e.g., America/New_York, Europe/Paris. If not provided, the time zone specified in agent settings is used. webhook-headers=key=sadipscing This field can be used to pass HTTP headers for a webhook call. These headers will be sent to webhook along with the headers that have been configured through the Dialogflow web console. The headers defined within this field will overwrite the headers configured through the Dialogflow console if there is a conflict. Header names are case-insensitive.

Effects are applied on top of each other in the order they are given. Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. pitch=0.6926055617166441 Optional. Speaking pitch, in the range [-20.0, 20.0]. 20 means increase 20 semitones from the original pitch. -20 means decrease 20 semitones from the original pitch. speaking-rate=0.19285972320303524 Optional. Speaking rate/speed, in the range [0.25, 4.0]. 1.0 is the normal native speed supported by the specific voice. 2.0 is twice as fast, and 0.5 is half as fast. If unset(0.0), defaults to the native 1.0 speed. Any other values < 0.25 or > 4.0 will return an error. voice name=rebum. Optional. The name of the voice. If not set, the service will choose a voice based on the other parameters such as language_code and ssml_gender. ssml-gender=invidunt Optional. The preferred gender of the voice. If not set, the service will choose a voice based on the other parameters such as language_code and name. Note that this is only a preference, not requirement. If a voice of the appropriate gender is not available, the synthesizer should substitute a voice with a different gender rather than failing the request. .. volume-gain-db=0.3075521043504721 Optional. Volume gain (in dB) of the normal native volume supported by the specific voice, in the range [-96.0, 16.0]. If unset, or set to a value of 0.0 (dB), will play at normal native signal amplitude. A value of -6.0 (dB) will play at approximately half the amplitude of the normal native signal amplitude. A value of +6.0 (dB) will play at approximately twice the amplitude of the normal native signal amplitude. We strongly recommend not to exceed +10 (dB) as there's usually no effective increase in loudness for any value greater than that. .. update-time=et Output only. Update time of the conversation profile. About Cursors The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. . Each additional . moves it up one additional level. E.g. ... would go three levels up. Optional Output Flags The method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default. -o out out specifies the destination to which to write the server's result to.

If enhanced speech model is enabled for the agent and an enhanced version of the specified model for the language does not exist, then the speech is recognized using the standard version of the specified model. Refer to Cloud Speech API documentation for more details. If you specify a model, the following models typically have the best performance: - phone_call (best for Agent Assist and telephony) - latest_short (best for Dialogflow non-telephony) - command_and_search Leave this field unspecified to use Agent Speech settings for model selection. speech-model-variant=no The speech model used in speech to text. SPEECH_MODEL_VARIANT_UNSPECIFIED , USE_BEST_AVAILABLE will be treated as USE_ENHANCED . It can be overridden in AnalyzeContentRequest and StreamingAnalyzeContentRequest request.

Speaking pitch, in the range [-20.0, 20.0]. 20 means increase 20 semitones from the original pitch. -20 means decrease 20 semitones from the original pitch. speaking-rate=0.6163747321206973 Optional. Speaking rate/speed, in the range [0.25, 4.0]. 1.0 is the normal native speed supported by the specific voice. 2.0 is twice as fast, and 0.5 is half as fast. If unset(0.0), defaults to the native 1.0 speed. Any other values < 0.25 or > 4.0 will return an error. voice name=ipsum Optional. The name of the voice.

If not set, the service will choose a voice based on the other parameters such as language_code and name. Note that this is only a preference, not requirement. If a voice of the appropriate gender is not available, the synthesizer should substitute a voice with a different gender rather than failing the request. .. volume-gain-db=0.8368840165252618 Optional. Volume gain (in dB) of the normal native volume supported by the specific voice, in the range [-96.0, 16.0]. If unset, or set to a value of 0.0 (dB), will play at normal native signal amplitude. A value of -6.0 (dB) will play at approximately half the amplitude of the normal native signal amplitude. A value of +6.0 (dB) will play at approximately twice the amplitude of the normal native signal amplitude. We strongly recommend not to exceed +10 (dB) as there's usually no effective increase in loudness for any value greater than that. .. update-time=sit Output only. Update time of the conversation profile. About Cursors The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. . Each additional . moves it up one additional level. E.g. ... would go three levels up. Optional Output Flags The method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default. -o out out specifies the destination to which to write the server's result to.

Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time. -r .assist-query-params documents-metadata-filters=key=magna Key-value filters on the metadata of documents returned by article suggestion. If specified, article suggestion only returns suggested documents that match all filters in their Document.metadata. Multiple values for a metadata key should be concatenated by comma. For example, filters to match all documents that have 'US' or 'CA' in their market metadata values and 'agent' in their user metadata values will be documents_metadata_filters { key: &#34;market&#34; value: &#34;US,CA&#34; } documents_metadata_filters { key: &#34;user&#34; value: &#34;agent&#34; } the value will be associated with the given key ..event-input language-code=stet Required. The language of this query. See Language Support for a list of the currently supported language codes. Note that queries in the same session do not necessarily need to specify the same language.

The unique identifier of the event. ..query-params.geo-location latitude=0.6790656712563893 The latitude in degrees. It must be in the range [-90.0, +90.0]. longitude=0.8646344354777213 The longitude in degrees. It must be in the range [-180.0, +180.0]. .. platform=ea The platform of the virtual agent response messages. If not empty, only emits messages from this platform in the response. Valid values are the enum names of platform. reset-contexts=true Specifies whether to delete all contexts in the current session before the new ones are activated. sentiment-analysis-request-config analyze-query-text-sentiment=false Instructs the service to perform sentiment analysis on query_text . If not provided, sentiment analysis is not performed on query_text . .. time-zone=dolores The time zone of this conversational query from the time zone database , e.g., America/New_York, Europe/Paris. If not provided, the time zone specified in agent settings is used. webhook-headers=key=justo This field can be used to pass HTTP headers for a webhook call. These headers will be sent to webhook along with the headers that have been configured through the Dialogflow web console. The headers defined within this field will overwrite the headers configured through the Dialogflow console if there is a conflict. Header names are case-insensitive. Google's specified headers are not allowed. Including: \"Host\", \"Content-Length\", \"Connection\", \"From\", \"User-Agent\", \"Accept-Encoding\", \"If-Modified-Since\", \"If-None-Match\", \"X-Forwarded-For\", etc. the value will be associated with the given key ..reply-audio-config audio-encoding=clita Required. Audio encoding of the synthesized audio content. sample-rate-hertz=86 The synthesis sample rate (in hertz) for this audio. If not provided, then the synthesizer will use the default sample rate based on the audio encoding. If this is different from the voice's natural sample rate, then the synthesizer will honor this request by converting to the desired sample rate (which might result in worse audio quality). synthesize-speech-config effects-profile-id=sea Optional. An identifier which selects 'audio effects' profiles that are applied on (post synthesized) text to speech. Effects are applied on top of each other in the order they are given. Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. pitch=0.025496528832166798 Optional. Speaking pitch, in the range [-20.0, 20.0]. 20 means increase 20 semitones from the original pitch. -20 means decrease 20 semitones from the original pitch. speaking-rate=0.517630847691609 Optional. Speaking rate/speed, in the range [0.25, 4.0]. 1.0 is the normal native speed supported by the specific voice. 2.0 is twice as fast, and 0.5 is half as fast. If unset(0.0), defaults to the native 1.0 speed. Any other values < 0.25 or > 4.0 will return an error. voice name=sit Optional. The name of the voice. If not set, the service will choose a voice based on the other parameters such as language_code and ssml_gender. ssml-gender=labore Optional. The preferred gender of the voice. If not set, the service will choose a voice based on the other parameters such as language_code and name. Note that this is only a preference, not requirement. If a voice of the appropriate gender is not available, the synthesizer should substitute a voice with a different gender rather than failing the request. .. volume-gain-db=0.887049684878022 Optional. Volume gain (in dB) of the normal native volume supported by the specific voice, in the range [-96.0, 16.0]. If unset, or set to a value of 0.0 (dB), will play at normal native signal amplitude. A value of -6.0 (dB) will play at approximately half the amplitude of the normal native signal amplitude. A value of +6.0 (dB) will play at approximately twice the amplitude of the normal native signal amplitude. We strongly recommend not to exceed +10 (dB) as there's usually no effective increase in loudness for any value greater than that. ... request-id=sea A unique identifier for this request. Restricted to 36 ASCII characters. A random UUID is recommended. This request is only idempotent if a request_id is provided. suggestion-input answer-record=sadipscing Required. The ID of a suggestion selected by the human agent. The suggestion(s) were generated in a previous call to request Dialogflow assist. The format is: projects//locations//answerRecords/ where is an alphanumeric string. ..text-input language-code=justo Required. The language of this conversational query. See Language Support for a list of the currently supported language codes. Note that queries in the same session do not necessarily need to specify the same language. text=aliquyam Required. The UTF-8 encoded natural language text to be processed. Text length must not exceed 256 characters for virtual agent interactions. About Cursors The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. . Each additional . moves it up one additional level. E.g. ... would go three levels up. Optional Output Flags The method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default. -o out out specifies the destination to which to write the server's result to.

The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. . Each additional . moves it up one additional level. E.g. ... would go three levels up. Optional Output Flags The method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default. -o out out specifies the destination to which to write the server's result to.

If a model is not explicitly specified, then Dialogflow auto-selects a model based on other parameters in the SpeechToTextConfig and Agent settings. If enhanced speech model is enabled for the agent and an enhanced version of the specified model for the language does not exist, then the speech is recognized using the standard version of the specified model. Refer to Cloud Speech API documentation for more details. If you specify a model, the following models typically have the best performance: - phone_call (best for Agent Assist and telephony) - latest_short (best for Dialogflow non-telephony) - command_and_search Leave this field unspecified to use Agent Speech settings for model selection. speech-model-variant=lorem The speech model used in speech to text. SPEECH_MODEL_VARIANT_UNSPECIFIED , USE_BEST_AVAILABLE will be treated as USE_ENHANCED . It can be overridden in AnalyzeContentRequest and StreamingAnalyzeContentRequest request.

If not set, the service will choose a voice based on the other parameters such as language_code and ssml_gender. ssml-gender=eirmod Optional. The preferred gender of the voice. If not set, the service will choose a voice based on the other parameters such as language_code and name. Note that this is only a preference, not requirement. If a voice of the appropriate gender is not available, the synthesizer should substitute a voice with a different gender rather than failing the request. .. volume-gain-db=0.860115319772763 Optional. Volume gain (in dB) of the normal native volume supported by the specific voice, in the range [-96.0, 16.0]. If unset, or set to a value of 0.0 (dB), will play at normal native signal amplitude. A value of -6.0 (dB) will play at approximately half the amplitude of the normal native signal amplitude. A value of +6.0 (dB) will play at approximately twice the amplitude of the normal native signal amplitude. We strongly recommend not to exceed +10 (dB) as there's usually no effective increase in loudness for any value greater than that. .. update-time=sed Output only. Update time of the conversation profile. .. latest-message=dolor The name of the latest conversation message used as context for generating a Summary.

The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. . Each additional . moves it up one additional level. E.g. ... would go three levels up.
