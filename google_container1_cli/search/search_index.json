By default all output is printed to standard out, but flags can be set to direct it into a file independent of your shell's capabilities. Errors will be printed to standard error, and cause the program's exit code to be non-zero. If data-structures are requested, these will be returned as pretty-printed JSON, to be useful as input to other tools. Everything else about the Container API can be found at the official documentation site . Installation and Source Code Install the command-line interface with cargo using: cargo install google-container1-cli Find the source code on github .

Each scope requires the user to grant this application permission to use it. If unset, it defaults to the shortest scope url for a particular method. --config-dir <folder> A directory into which we will store our persistent data. Defaults to a user-writable directory that we will create during the first invocation. [default: ~/.google-service-cli] Configuration The program will store all persistent data in the ~/.google-service-cli directory in JSON files prefixed with container1- . You can change the directory used to store configuration with the --config-dir flag on a per-invocation basis. More information about the various kinds of persistent data are given in the following paragraphs. Authentication Most APIs require a user to authenticate any request. If this is the case, the scope determines the set of permissions granted. The granularity of these is usually no more than read-only or full-access . If not set, the system will automatically select the smallest feasible scope, e.g. when invoking a method that is read-only, it will ask only for a read-only scope. You may use the --scope flag to specify a scope directly. All applicable scopes are documented in the respective method's CLI documentation. The first time a scope is used, the user is asked for permission. Follow the instructions given by the CLI to grant permissions, or to decline. If a scope was authenticated by the user, the respective information will be stored as JSON in the configuration directory, e.g. ~/.google-service-cli/container1-token-<scope-hash>.json . No manual management of these tokens is necessary. To revoke granted authentication, please refer to the official documentation . Application Secrets In order to allow any application to use Google services, it will need to be registered using the Google Developer Console . APIs the application may use are then enabled for it one by one. Most APIs can be used for free and have a daily quota. To allow more comfortable usage of the CLI without forcing anyone to register an own application, the CLI comes with a default application secret that is configured accordingly. This also means that heavy usage all around the world may deplete the daily quota. You can workaround this limitation by putting your own secrets file at this location: ~/.google-service-cli/container1-secret.json , assuming that the required container API was enabled for it. Such a secret file can be downloaded in the Google Developer Console at APIs & auth -> Credentials -> Download JSON and used as is. Learn more about how to setup Google projects and enable APIs using the official documentation . Debugging Even though the CLI does its best to provide usable error messages, sometimes it might be desirable to know what exactly led to a particular issue. This is done by allowing all client-server communication to be output to standard error as-is . The --debug flag will print errors using the Debug representation to standard error. You may consider redirecting standard error into a file for ease of use, e.g. container1 --debug <resource> <method> [options] 2>debug.txt .","title":"Home"},{"location":"#installation-and-source-code","text":"Install the command-line interface with cargo using: cargo install google-container1-cli Find the source code on github .","title":"Installation and Source Code"},{"location":"#usage","text":"This documentation was generated from the Container API at revision 20240214 .

The name of the cluster to update. maintenance-policy resource-version=justo A hash identifying the version of this policy, so that updates to fields of the policy won't accidentally undo intermediate changes (and so that users of the API unaware of some fields won't accidentally remove other fields). Make a get() request to the cluster to get the current resource version and include it with requests to set the policy. window.daily-maintenance-window duration=lorem [Output only] Duration of the time window, automatically chosen to be smallest possible in the given scenario.

For example, to have something repeat every weekday, you'd use: FREQ=WEEKLY;BYDAY=MO,TU,WE,TH,FR To repeat some window daily (equivalent to the DailyMaintenanceWindow): FREQ=DAILY For the first weekend of every month: FREQ=MONTHLY;BYSETPOS=1;BYDAY=SA,SU This specifies how frequently the window starts. Eg, if you wanted to have a 9-5 UTC-4 window every weekday, you'd use something like: start time = 2019-01-01T09:00:00-0400 end time = 2019-01-01T17:00:00-0400 recurrence = FREQ=WEEKLY;BYDAY=MO,TU,WE,TH,FR Windows can span multiple days. Eg, to make the window encompass every weekend from midnight Saturday till the last minute of Sunday UTC: start time = 2019-01-05T00:00:00Z end time = 2019-01-07T23:59:00Z recurrence = FREQ=WEEKLY;BYDAY=SA Note the start and end time's specific dates are largely arbitrary except to specify duration of the window and when it first starts. The FREQ values of HOURLY, MINUTELY, and SECONDLY are not supported. window end-time=vero The time that the window ends.

The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. . Each additional . moves it up one additional level. E.g. ... would go three levels up. Optional Output Flags The method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default. -o out out specifies the destination to which to write the server's result to.

For Gen3 machines which dictate a specific number of local ssds, zero (or unset) means to use the default number of local ssds that goes with that machine type. For example, for a c3-standard-8-lssd machine, 2 local ssds would be provisioned. For c3-standard-8 (which doesn't support local ssds), 0 will be provisioned.

Please see https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/node-images for available image types. kubelet-config cpu-cfs-quota=false Enable CPU CFS quota enforcement for containers that specify CPU limits. This option is enabled by default which makes kubelet use CFS quota (https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/scheduler/sched-bwc.txt) to enforce container CPU limits. Otherwise, CPU limits will not be enforced at all. Disable this option to mitigate CPU throttling problems while still having your pods to be in Guaranteed QoS class by specifying the CPU limits. The default value is 'true' if unspecified. cpu-cfs-quota-period=nonumy Set the CPU CFS quota period value 'cpu.cfs_period_us'. The string must be a sequence of decimal numbers, each with optional fraction and a unit suffix, such as \"300ms\". Valid time units are \"ns\", \"us\" (or \"\u00b5s\"), \"ms\", \"s\", \"m\", \"h\". The value must be a positive duration. cpu-manager-policy=sit Control the CPU management policy on the node. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/cpu-management-policies/ The following values are allowed. * \"none\": the default, which represents the existing scheduling behavior. * \"static\": allows pods with certain resource characteristics to be granted increased CPU affinity and exclusivity on the node. The default value is 'none' if unspecified. insecure-kubelet-readonly-port-enabled=true Enable or disable Kubelet read only port. pod-pids-limit=amet. Set the Pod PID limits.

The limit for this value is dependent upon the maximum number of disk available on a machine per zone. See: https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/local-ssd for more information. A zero (or unset) value has different meanings depending on machine type being used: 1. For pre-Gen3 machines, which support flexible numbers of local ssds, zero (or unset) means to disable using local SSDs as ephemeral storage. 2.

Each field may be a simple scalar or another data-structure. In the latter case it is advised to set the field-cursor to the data-structure's field to specify values more concisely. For example, a structure like this: CancelOperationRequest: name: string operation-id: string project-id: string zone: string can be set completely with the following arguments which are assumed to be executed in the given order.

The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. .
