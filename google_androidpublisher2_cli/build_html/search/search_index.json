By default all output is printed to standard out, but flags can be set to direct it into a file independent of your shell's capabilities. Errors will be printed to standard error, and cause the program's exit code to be non-zero. If data-structures are requested, these will be returned as pretty-printed JSON, to be useful as input to other tools. Everything else about the Android Publisher API can be found at the official documentation site . Installation and Source Code Install the command-line interface with cargo using: cargo install google-androidpublisher2-cli Find the source code on github .

Each scope requires the user to grant this application permission to use it. If unset, it defaults to the shortest scope url for a particular method. --config-dir <folder> A directory into which we will store our persistent data. Defaults to a user-writable directory that we will create during the first invocation. [default: ~/.google-service-cli] Configuration The program will store all persistent data in the ~/.google-service-cli directory in JSON files prefixed with androidpublisher2- . You can change the directory used to store configuration with the --config-dir flag on a per-invocation basis. More information about the various kinds of persistent data are given in the following paragraphs. Authentication Most APIs require a user to authenticate any request. If this is the case, the scope determines the set of permissions granted. The granularity of these is usually no more than read-only or full-access . If not set, the system will automatically select the smallest feasible scope, e.g. when invoking a method that is read-only, it will ask only for a read-only scope. You may use the --scope flag to specify a scope directly. All applicable scopes are documented in the respective method's CLI documentation. The first time a scope is used, the user is asked for permission. Follow the instructions given by the CLI to grant permissions, or to decline. If a scope was authenticated by the user, the respective information will be stored as JSON in the configuration directory, e.g. ~/.google-service-cli/androidpublisher2-token-<scope-hash>.json . No manual management of these tokens is necessary. To revoke granted authentication, please refer to the official documentation . Application Secrets In order to allow any application to use Google services, it will need to be registered using the Google Developer Console . APIs the application may use are then enabled for it one by one. Most APIs can be used for free and have a daily quota. To allow more comfortable usage of the CLI without forcing anyone to register an own application, the CLI comes with a default application secret that is configured accordingly. This also means that heavy usage all around the world may deplete the daily quota. You can workaround this limitation by putting your own secrets file at this location: ~/.google-service-cli/androidpublisher2-secret.json , assuming that the required androidpublisher API was enabled for it. Such a secret file can be downloaded in the Google Developer Console at APIs & auth -> Credentials -> Download JSON and used as is. Learn more about how to setup Google projects and enable APIs using the official documentation . Debugging Even though the CLI does its best to provide usable error messages, sometimes it might be desirable to know what exactly led to a particular issue. This is done by allowing all client-server communication to be output to standard error as-is . The --debug flag will print errors using the Debug representation to standard error. You may consider redirecting standard error into a file for ease of use, e.g. androidpublisher2 --debug <resource> <method> [options] 2>debug.txt .","title":"Home"},{"location":"#installation-and-source-code","text":"Install the command-line interface with cargo using: cargo install google-androidpublisher2-cli Find the source code on github .","title":"Installation and Source Code"},{"location":"#usage","text":"This documentation was generated from the Android Publisher API at revision 20200331 .

Required Request Value The request value is a data-structure with various fields. Each field may be a simple scalar or another data-structure. In the latter case it is advised to set the field-cursor to the data-structure's field to specify values more concisely. For example, a structure like this: AppDetails: contact-email: string contact-phone: string contact-website: string default-language: string can be set completely with the following arguments which are assumed to be executed in the given order. Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time. -r . contact-email=duo The user-visible support email for this app. contact-phone=ipsum The user-visible support telephone number for this app. contact-website=sed The user-visible website for this app. default-language=ut Default language code, in BCP 47 format (eg \"en-US\"). About Cursors The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. .

Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time. -r . expiry-time-seconds=ipsum The time at which the edit will expire and will be no longer valid for use in any subsequent API calls (encoded as seconds since the Epoch). id=est The ID of the edit that can be used in subsequent API calls. About Cursors The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. .

For example, a structure like this: InAppProduct: default-language: string default-price: currency: string price-micros: string grace-period: string package-name: string purchase-type: string sku: string status: string subscription-period: string trial-period: string can be set completely with the following arguments which are assumed to be executed in the given order. Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time. -r . default-language=dolore The default language of the localized data, as defined by BCP 47. e.g. \"en-US\", \"en-GB\". default-price currency=et 3 letter Currency code, as defined by ISO 4217. price-micros=voluptua. The price in millionths of the currency base unit represented as a string. .. grace-period=amet. Grace period of the subscription, specified in ISO 8601 format. It will allow developers to give their subscribers a grace period when the payment for the new recurrence period is declined. Acceptable values = \"P3D\" (three days), \"P7D\" (seven days), \"P14D\" (fourteen days), and \"P30D\" (thirty days) package-name=consetetur The package name of the parent app. purchase-type=diam Purchase type enum value. Unmodifiable after creation. sku=dolor The stock-keeping-unit (SKU) of the product, unique within an app. status=et No description provided. subscription-period=et Subscription period, specified in ISO 8601 format. Acceptable values are \"P1W\" (one week), \"P1M\" (one month), \"P3M\" (three months), \"P6M\" (six months), and \"P1Y\" (one year). trial-period=sadipscing Trial period, specified in ISO 8601 format. Acceptable values are anything between \"P7D\" (seven days) and \"P999D\" (999 days). Seasonal subscriptions cannot have a trial period. About Cursors The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. . Each additional . moves it up one additional level. E.g. ... would go three levels up. Optional Output Flags The method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default. -o out out specifies the destination to which to write the server's result to. It will be a JSON-encoded structure. The destination may be - to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes. If unset, it defaults to standard output. Optional Method Properties You may set the following properties to further configure the call. Please note that -p is followed by one or more key-value-pairs, and is called like this -p k1=v1 k2=v2 even though the listing below repeats the -p for completeness. -p auto-convert-missing-prices=boolean If true the prices for all regions targeted by the parent app that don't have a price specified for this in-app product will be auto converted to the target currency based on the default price. Defaults to false. Optional General Properties The following properties can configure any call, and are not specific to this method. -p alt=string Data format for the response. -p fields=string Selector specifying which fields to include in a partial response. -p key=string API key.
