By default all output is printed to standard out, but flags can be set to direct it into a file independent of your shell's capabilities. Errors will be printed to standard error, and cause the program's exit code to be non-zero. If data-structures are requested, these will be returned as pretty-printed JSON, to be useful as input to other tools. Everything else about the SQL Admin API can be found at the official documentation site . Installation and Source Code Install the command-line interface with cargo using: cargo install google-sqladmin1_beta4-cli Find the source code on github .

Each scope requires the user to grant this application permission to use it. If unset, it defaults to the shortest scope url for a particular method. --config-dir <folder> A directory into which we will store our persistent data. Defaults to a user-writable directory that we will create during the first invocation. [default: ~/.google-service-cli] Configuration The program will store all persistent data in the ~/.google-service-cli directory in JSON files prefixed with sqladmin1-beta4- . You can change the directory used to store configuration with the --config-dir flag on a per-invocation basis. More information about the various kinds of persistent data are given in the following paragraphs. Authentication Most APIs require a user to authenticate any request. If this is the case, the scope determines the set of permissions granted. The granularity of these is usually no more than read-only or full-access . If not set, the system will automatically select the smallest feasible scope, e.g. when invoking a method that is read-only, it will ask only for a read-only scope. You may use the --scope flag to specify a scope directly. All applicable scopes are documented in the respective method's CLI documentation. The first time a scope is used, the user is asked for permission. Follow the instructions given by the CLI to grant permissions, or to decline. If a scope was authenticated by the user, the respective information will be stored as JSON in the configuration directory, e.g. ~/.google-service-cli/sqladmin1-beta4-token-<scope-hash>.json . No manual management of these tokens is necessary. To revoke granted authentication, please refer to the official documentation . Application Secrets In order to allow any application to use Google services, it will need to be registered using the Google Developer Console . APIs the application may use are then enabled for it one by one. Most APIs can be used for free and have a daily quota. To allow more comfortable usage of the CLI without forcing anyone to register an own application, the CLI comes with a default application secret that is configured accordingly. This also means that heavy usage all around the world may deplete the daily quota. You can workaround this limitation by putting your own secrets file at this location: ~/.google-service-cli/sqladmin1-beta4-secret.json , assuming that the required sqladmin API was enabled for it. Such a secret file can be downloaded in the Google Developer Console at APIs & auth -> Credentials -> Download JSON and used as is. Learn more about how to setup Google projects and enable APIs using the official documentation . Debugging Even though the CLI does its best to provide usable error messages, sometimes it might be desirable to know what exactly led to a particular issue. This is done by allowing all client-server communication to be output to standard error as-is . The --debug flag will print errors using the Debug representation to standard error. You may consider redirecting standard error into a file for ease of use, e.g. sqladmin1-beta4 --debug <resource> <method> [options] 2>debug.txt .","title":"Home"},{"location":"#installation-and-source-code","text":"Install the command-line interface with cargo using: cargo install google-sqladmin1_beta4-cli Find the source code on github .","title":"Installation and Source Code"},{"location":"#usage","text":"This documentation was generated from the SQL Admin API at revision 20240219 .

Required Scalar Arguments <project> (string) Project ID of the project that contains the instance. <instance> (string) Cloud SQL instance ID. This does not include the project ID. Required Request Value The request value is a data-structure with various fields. Each field may be a simple scalar or another data-structure. In the latter case it is advised to set the field-cursor to the data-structure's field to specify values more concisely. For example, a structure like this: BackupRun: backup-kind: string description: string disk-encryption-configuration: kind: string kms-key-name: string disk-encryption-status: kind: string kms-key-version-name: string end-time: string enqueued-time: string error: code: string kind: string message: string id: string instance: string kind: string location: string self-link: string start-time: string status: string time-zone: string type: string window-start-time: string can be set completely with the following arguments which are assumed to be executed in the given order. Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time. -r . backup-kind=et Specifies the kind of backup, PHYSICAL or DEFAULT_SNAPSHOT. description=magna The description of this run, only applicable to on-demand backups. disk-encryption-configuration kind=no This is always sql#diskEncryptionConfiguration . kms-key-name=ipsum Resource name of KMS key for disk encryption ..disk-encryption-status kind=voluptua. This is always sql#diskEncryptionStatus . kms-key-version-name=at KMS key version used to encrypt the Cloud SQL instance resource .. end-time=sanctus The time the backup operation completed in UTC timezone in RFC 3339 format, for example 2012-11-15T16:19:00.094Z . enqueued-time=sed The time the run was enqueued in UTC timezone in RFC 3339 format, for example 2012-11-15T16:19:00.094Z . error code=amet. Identifies the specific error that occurred. kind=takimata This is always sql#operationError . message=amet. Additional information about the error encountered. .. id=duo The identifier for this backup run. Unique only for a specific Cloud SQL instance. instance=ipsum Name of the database instance. kind=gubergren This is always sql#backupRun . location=lorem Location of the backups. self-link=gubergren The URI of this resource. start-time=eos The time the backup operation actually started in UTC timezone in RFC 3339 format, for example 2012-11-15T16:19:00.094Z . status=dolor The status of this run. time-zone=ea Backup time zone to prevent restores to an instance with a different time zone. Now relevant only for SQL Server. type=ipsum The type of this run; can be either \"AUTOMATED\" or \"ON_DEMAND\" or \"FINAL\". This field defaults to \"ON_DEMAND\" and is ignored, when specified for insert requests. window-start-time=invidunt The start time of the backup window during which this the backup was attempted in RFC 3339 format, for example 2012-11-15T16:19:00.094Z . About Cursors The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. . Each additional . moves it up one additional level. E.g. ... would go three levels up.

The list of consumer projects that are allow-listed for PSC connections to this instance. This instance can be connected to with PSC from any network in these projects. Each consumer project in this list may be represented by a project number (numeric) or by a project id (alphanumeric). Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. psc-enabled=false Whether PSC connectivity is enabled for this instance. .. require-ssl=false Use ssl_mode instead for MySQL and PostgreSQL. SQL Server uses this flag. Whether SSL/TLS connections over IP are enforced. If set to false, then allow both non-SSL/non-TLS and SSL/TLS connections. For SSL/TLS connections, the client certificate won't be verified. If set to true, then only allow connections encrypted with SSL/TLS and with valid client certificates. If you want to enforce SSL/TLS without enforcing the requirement for valid client certificates, then use the ssl_mode flag instead of the legacy require_ssl flag. ssl-mode=diam Specify how SSL/TLS is enforced in database connections. MySQL and PostgreSQL use the ssl_mode flag. If you must use the require_ssl flag for backward compatibility, then only the following value pairs are valid: * ssl_mode=ALLOW_UNENCRYPTED_AND_ENCRYPTED and require_ssl=false * ssl_mode=ENCRYPTED_ONLY and require_ssl=false * ssl_mode=TRUSTED_CLIENT_CERTIFICATE_REQUIRED and require_ssl=true The value of ssl_mode gets priority over the value of require_ssl . For example, for the pair ssl_mode=ENCRYPTED_ONLY and require_ssl=false , the ssl_mode=ENCRYPTED_ONLY means only accept SSL connections, while the require_ssl=false means accept both non-SSL and SSL connections. MySQL and PostgreSQL databases respect ssl_mode in this case and accept only SSL connections. SQL Server uses the require_ssl flag. You can set the value for this flag to true or false . .. kind=nonumy This is always sql#settings . location-preference follow-gae-application=et The App Engine application to follow, it must be in the same region as the Cloud SQL instance.

About Cursors The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. .

Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. psc-enabled=false Whether PSC connectivity is enabled for this instance. .. require-ssl=false Use ssl_mode instead for MySQL and PostgreSQL. SQL Server uses this flag. Whether SSL/TLS connections over IP are enforced. If set to false, then allow both non-SSL/non-TLS and SSL/TLS connections. For SSL/TLS connections, the client certificate won't be verified. If set to true, then only allow connections encrypted with SSL/TLS and with valid client certificates. If you want to enforce SSL/TLS without enforcing the requirement for valid client certificates, then use the ssl_mode flag instead of the legacy require_ssl flag. ssl-mode=diam Specify how SSL/TLS is enforced in database connections. MySQL and PostgreSQL use the ssl_mode flag. If you must use the require_ssl flag for backward compatibility, then only the following value pairs are valid: * ssl_mode=ALLOW_UNENCRYPTED_AND_ENCRYPTED and require_ssl=false * ssl_mode=ENCRYPTED_ONLY and require_ssl=false * ssl_mode=TRUSTED_CLIENT_CERTIFICATE_REQUIRED and require_ssl=true The value of ssl_mode gets priority over the value of require_ssl . For example, for the pair ssl_mode=ENCRYPTED_ONLY and require_ssl=false , the ssl_mode=ENCRYPTED_ONLY means only accept SSL connections, while the require_ssl=false means accept both non-SSL and SSL connections. MySQL and PostgreSQL databases respect ssl_mode in this case and accept only SSL connections. SQL Server uses the require_ssl flag. You can set the value for this flag to true or false . .. kind=nonumy This is always sql#settings . location-preference follow-gae-application=et The App Engine application to follow, it must be in the same region as the Cloud SQL instance.

The list of consumer projects that are allow-listed for PSC connections to this instance. This instance can be connected to with PSC from any network in these projects. Each consumer project in this list may be represented by a project number (numeric) or by a project id (alphanumeric). Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. psc-enabled=true Whether PSC connectivity is enabled for this instance. .. require-ssl=true Use ssl_mode instead for MySQL and PostgreSQL. SQL Server uses this flag. Whether SSL/TLS connections over IP are enforced. If set to false, then allow both non-SSL/non-TLS and SSL/TLS connections. For SSL/TLS connections, the client certificate won't be verified. If set to true, then only allow connections encrypted with SSL/TLS and with valid client certificates. If you want to enforce SSL/TLS without enforcing the requirement for valid client certificates, then use the ssl_mode flag instead of the legacy require_ssl flag. ssl-mode=sea Specify how SSL/TLS is enforced in database connections. MySQL and PostgreSQL use the ssl_mode flag. If you must use the require_ssl flag for backward compatibility, then only the following value pairs are valid: * ssl_mode=ALLOW_UNENCRYPTED_AND_ENCRYPTED and require_ssl=false * ssl_mode=ENCRYPTED_ONLY and require_ssl=false * ssl_mode=TRUSTED_CLIENT_CERTIFICATE_REQUIRED and require_ssl=true The value of ssl_mode gets priority over the value of require_ssl . For example, for the pair ssl_mode=ENCRYPTED_ONLY and require_ssl=false , the ssl_mode=ENCRYPTED_ONLY means only accept SSL connections, while the require_ssl=false means accept both non-SSL and SSL connections. MySQL and PostgreSQL databases respect ssl_mode in this case and accept only SSL connections. SQL Server uses the require_ssl flag. You can set the value for this flag to true or false . .. kind=sit This is always sql#settings . location-preference follow-gae-application=amet.

Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. write-endpoint=elitr Output only. The dns name of the primary instance in a replication group. About Cursors The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. . Each additional . moves it up one additional level. E.g. ... would go three levels up. Optional Output Flags The method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default. -o out out specifies the destination to which to write the server's result to.

The list of consumer projects that are allow-listed for PSC connections to this instance. This instance can be connected to with PSC from any network in these projects. Each consumer project in this list may be represented by a project number (numeric) or by a project id (alphanumeric). Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. psc-enabled=true Whether PSC connectivity is enabled for this instance. .. require-ssl=true Use ssl_mode instead for MySQL and PostgreSQL. SQL Server uses this flag. Whether SSL/TLS connections over IP are enforced. If set to false, then allow both non-SSL/non-TLS and SSL/TLS connections. For SSL/TLS connections, the client certificate won't be verified. If set to true, then only allow connections encrypted with SSL/TLS and with valid client certificates. If you want to enforce SSL/TLS without enforcing the requirement for valid client certificates, then use the ssl_mode flag instead of the legacy require_ssl flag. ssl-mode=sea Specify how SSL/TLS is enforced in database connections. MySQL and PostgreSQL use the ssl_mode flag. If you must use the require_ssl flag for backward compatibility, then only the following value pairs are valid: * ssl_mode=ALLOW_UNENCRYPTED_AND_ENCRYPTED and require_ssl=false * ssl_mode=ENCRYPTED_ONLY and require_ssl=false * ssl_mode=TRUSTED_CLIENT_CERTIFICATE_REQUIRED and require_ssl=true The value of ssl_mode gets priority over the value of require_ssl . For example, for the pair ssl_mode=ENCRYPTED_ONLY and require_ssl=false , the ssl_mode=ENCRYPTED_ONLY means only accept SSL connections, while the require_ssl=false means accept both non-SSL and SSL connections. MySQL and PostgreSQL databases respect ssl_mode in this case and accept only SSL connections. SQL Server uses the require_ssl flag. You can set the value for this flag to true or false . .. kind=sit This is always sql#settings . location-preference follow-gae-application=amet.

In the latter case it is advised to set the field-cursor to the data-structure's field to specify values more concisely. For example, a structure like this: User: dual-password-type: string etag: string host: string instance: string kind: string name: string password: string password-policy: allowed-failed-attempts: integer enable-failed-attempts-check: boolean enable-password-verification: boolean password-expiration-duration: string status: locked: boolean password-expiration-time: string project: string sqlserver-user-details: disabled: boolean server-roles: [string] type: string can be set completely with the following arguments which are assumed to be executed in the given order.
