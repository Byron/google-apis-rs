By default all output is printed to standard out, but flags can be set to direct it into a file independent of your shell's capabilities. Errors will be printed to standard error, and cause the program's exit code to be non-zero. If data-structures are requested, these will be returned as pretty-printed JSON, to be useful as input to other tools. Everything else about the Cloud Dataplex API can be found at the official documentation site . Installation and Source Code Install the command-line interface with cargo using: cargo install google-dataplex1-cli Find the source code on github .

[-o <out>] dataplex1 --help Configuration: [--scope <url>]... Specify the authentication a method should be executed in. Each scope requires the user to grant this application permission to use it. If unset, it defaults to the shortest scope url for a particular method. --config-dir <folder> A directory into which we will store our persistent data. Defaults to a user-writable directory that we will create during the first invocation. [default: ~/.google-service-cli] Configuration The program will store all persistent data in the ~/.google-service-cli directory in JSON files prefixed with dataplex1- . You can change the directory used to store configuration with the --config-dir flag on a per-invocation basis. More information about the various kinds of persistent data are given in the following paragraphs. Authentication Most APIs require a user to authenticate any request. If this is the case, the scope determines the set of permissions granted. The granularity of these is usually no more than read-only or full-access . If not set, the system will automatically select the smallest feasible scope, e.g. when invoking a method that is read-only, it will ask only for a read-only scope. You may use the --scope flag to specify a scope directly. All applicable scopes are documented in the respective method's CLI documentation. The first time a scope is used, the user is asked for permission. Follow the instructions given by the CLI to grant permissions, or to decline. If a scope was authenticated by the user, the respective information will be stored as JSON in the configuration directory, e.g. ~/.google-service-cli/dataplex1-token-<scope-hash>.json . No manual management of these tokens is necessary. To revoke granted authentication, please refer to the official documentation . Application Secrets In order to allow any application to use Google services, it will need to be registered using the Google Developer Console . APIs the application may use are then enabled for it one by one. Most APIs can be used for free and have a daily quota. To allow more comfortable usage of the CLI without forcing anyone to register an own application, the CLI comes with a default application secret that is configured accordingly. This also means that heavy usage all around the world may deplete the daily quota. You can workaround this limitation by putting your own secrets file at this location: ~/.google-service-cli/dataplex1-secret.json , assuming that the required dataplex API was enabled for it. Such a secret file can be downloaded in the Google Developer Console at APIs & auth -> Credentials -> Download JSON and used as is. Learn more about how to setup Google projects and enable APIs using the official documentation . Debugging Even though the CLI does its best to provide usable error messages, sometimes it might be desirable to know what exactly led to a particular issue. This is done by allowing all client-server communication to be output to standard error as-is . The --debug flag will print errors using the Debug representation to standard error. You may consider redirecting standard error into a file for ease of use, e.g. dataplex1 --debug <resource> <method> [options] 2>debug.txt .","title":"Home"},{"location":"#installation-and-source-code","text":"Install the command-line interface with cargo using: cargo install google-dataplex1-cli Find the source code on github .","title":"Installation and Source Code"},{"location":"#usage","text":"This documentation was generated from the Cloud Dataplex API at revision 20240224 .

About Cursors The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. . Each additional . moves it up one additional level. E.g. ... would go three levels up. Optional Output Flags The method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default. -o out out specifies the destination to which to write the server's result to. It will be a JSON-encoded structure. The destination may be - to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes. If unset, it defaults to standard output.

This ID will be different if the scan is deleted and re-created with the same name. update-time=at Output only. The time when the scan was last updated. About Cursors The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. . Each additional . moves it up one additional level. E.g. ... would go three levels up. Optional Output Flags The method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default. -o out out specifies the destination to which to write the server's result to. It will be a JSON-encoded structure. The destination may be - to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes. If unset, it defaults to standard output.

Permissions with wildcards (such as * or storage.*) are not allowed. For more information see IAM Overview (https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/overview#permissions). Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. About Cursors The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. .

Each field may be a simple scalar or another data-structure. In the latter case it is advised to set the field-cursor to the data-structure's field to specify values more concisely. For example, a structure like this: GoogleIamV1SetIamPolicyRequest: policy: etag: string version: integer update-mask: string can be set completely with the following arguments which are assumed to be executed in the given order. Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time. -r .policy etag=accusam etag is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help prevent simultaneous updates of a policy from overwriting each other. It is strongly suggested that systems make use of the etag in the read-modify-write cycle to perform policy updates in order to avoid race conditions: An etag is returned in the response to getIamPolicy, and systems are expected to put that etag in the request to setIamPolicy to ensure that their change will be applied to the same version of the policy.Important: If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the etag field whenever you call setIamPolicy. If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to overwrite a version 3 policy with a version 1 policy, and all of the conditions in the version 3 policy are lost. version=39 Specifies the format of the policy.Valid values are 0, 1, and 3. Requests that specify an invalid value are rejected.Any operation that affects conditional role bindings must specify version 3. This requirement applies to the following operations: Getting a policy that includes a conditional role binding Adding a conditional role binding to a policy Changing a conditional role binding in a policy Removing any role binding, with or without a condition, from a policy that includes conditionsImportant: If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the etag field whenever you call setIamPolicy. If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to overwrite a version 3 policy with a version 1 policy, and all of the conditions in the version 3 policy are lost.If a policy does not include any conditions, operations on that policy may specify any valid version or leave the field unset.To learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the IAM documentation (https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies). .. update-mask=sadipscing OPTIONAL: A FieldMask specifying which fields of the policy to modify. Only the fields in the mask will be modified. If no mask is provided, the following default mask is used:paths: \"bindings, etag\" About Cursors The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. . Each additional . moves it up one additional level. E.g. ... would go three levels up. Optional Output Flags The method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default. -o out out specifies the destination to which to write the server's result to.

The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. . Each additional . moves it up one additional level. E.g. ... would go three levels up. Optional Output Flags The method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default. -o out out specifies the destination to which to write the server's result to.

Each field may be a simple scalar or another data-structure. In the latter case it is advised to set the field-cursor to the data-structure's field to specify values more concisely. For example, a structure like this: GoogleIamV1TestIamPermissionsRequest: permissions: [string] can be set completely with the following arguments which are assumed to be executed in the given order. Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time. -r . permissions=stet The set of permissions to check for the resource. Permissions with wildcards (such as * or storage.*) are not allowed. For more information see IAM Overview (https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/overview#permissions). Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. About Cursors The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. . Each additional . moves it up one additional level. E.g. ... would go three levels up.

The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. . Each additional . moves it up one additional level. E.g. ... would go three levels up. Optional Output Flags The method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default. -o out out specifies the destination to which to write the server's result to.

It is strongly suggested that systems make use of the etag in the read-modify-write cycle to perform policy updates in order to avoid race conditions: An etag is returned in the response to getIamPolicy, and systems are expected to put that etag in the request to setIamPolicy to ensure that their change will be applied to the same version of the policy.Important: If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the etag field whenever you call setIamPolicy. If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to overwrite a version 3 policy with a version 1 policy, and all of the conditions in the version 3 policy are lost. version=78 Specifies the format of the policy.Valid values are 0, 1, and 3.

About Cursors The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. . Each additional . moves it up one additional level. E.g. ... would go three levels up.

If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to overwrite a version 3 policy with a version 1 policy, and all of the conditions in the version 3 policy are lost. version=46 Specifies the format of the policy.Valid values are 0, 1, and 3. Requests that specify an invalid value are rejected.Any operation that affects conditional role bindings must specify version 3. This requirement applies to the following operations: Getting a policy that includes a conditional role binding Adding a conditional role binding to a policy Changing a conditional role binding in a policy Removing any role binding, with or without a condition, from a policy that includes conditionsImportant: If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the etag field whenever you call setIamPolicy. If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to overwrite a version 3 policy with a version 1 policy, and all of the conditions in the version 3 policy are lost.If a policy does not include any conditions, operations on that policy may specify any valid version or leave the field unset.To learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the IAM documentation (https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies). .. update-mask=sea OPTIONAL: A FieldMask specifying which fields of the policy to modify.

In the latter case it is advised to set the field-cursor to the data-structure's field to specify values more concisely. For example, a structure like this: GoogleCloudDataplexV1Entity: access: read: string asset: string catalog-entry: string compatibility: bigquery: compatible: boolean reason: string hive-metastore: compatible: boolean reason: string create-time: string data-path: string data-path-pattern: string description: string display-name: string etag: string format: compression-format: string csv: delimiter: string encoding: string header-rows: integer quote: string format: string iceberg: metadata-location: string json: encoding: string mime-type: string id: string name: string schema: partition-style: string user-managed: boolean system: string type: string uid: string update-time: string can be set completely with the following arguments which are assumed to be executed in the given order.

The storage path of the entity data. For Cloud Storage data, this is the fully-qualified path to the entity, such as gs://bucket/path/to/data. For BigQuery data, this is the name of the table resource, such as projects/project_id/datasets/dataset_id/tables/table_id. data-path-pattern=invidunt Optional. The set of items within the data path constituting the data in the entity, represented as a glob path. Example: gs://bucket/path/to/data/* / .csv. description=invidunt Optional.

The number of rows to interpret as header rows that should be skipped when reading data rows. Defaults to 0. quote=et Optional. The character used to quote column values. Accepts '\"' (double quotation mark) or ''' (single quotation mark). Defaults to '\"' (double quotation mark) if unspecified. .. format=ea Output only. The data format associated with the stored data, which represents content type values. The value is inferred from mime type. iceberg metadata-location=dolor Optional. The location of where the iceberg metadata is present, must be within the table path ..json encoding=sadipscing Optional. The character encoding of the data.

The default is false (managed by Dataplex). Set to falseto enable Dataplex discovery to update the schema. including new data discovery, schema inference, and schema evolution. Users retain the ability to input and edit the schema. Dataplex treats schema input by the user as though produced by a previous Dataplex discovery operation, and it will evolve the schema and take action based on that treatment. Set to true to fully manage the entity schema. This setting guarantees that Dataplex will not change schema fields. .. system=est Required. Immutable. Identifies the storage system of the entity data. type=gubergren Required. Immutable. The type of entity. uid=eos Output only. System generated unique ID for the Entity. This ID will be different if the Entity is deleted and re-created with the same name. update-time=dolore Output only. The time when the entity was last updated. About Cursors The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. . Each additional . moves it up one additional level. E.g. ... would go three levels up. Optional Output Flags The method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default. -o out out specifies the destination to which to write the server's result to. It will be a JSON-encoded structure. The destination may be - to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes. If unset, it defaults to standard output.

About Cursors The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. . Each additional . moves it up one additional level. E.g. ... would go three levels up. Optional Output Flags The method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default. -o out out specifies the destination to which to write the server's result to. It will be a JSON-encoded structure. The destination may be - to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes. If unset, it defaults to standard output.

For example, a structure like this: GoogleCloudDataplexV1Zone: asset-status: active-assets: integer security-policy-applying-assets: integer update-time: string create-time: string description: string discovery-spec: csv-options: delimiter: string disable-type-inference: boolean encoding: string header-rows: integer enabled: boolean exclude-patterns: [string] include-patterns: [string] json-options: disable-type-inference: boolean encoding: string schedule: string display-name: string labels: { string: string } name: string resource-spec: location-type: string state: string type: string uid: string update-time: string can be set completely with the following arguments which are assumed to be executed in the given order. Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time. -r .asset-status active-assets=15 Number of active assets. security-policy-applying-assets=83 Number of assets that are in process of updating the security policy on attached resources. update-time=aliquyam Last update time of the status. .. create-time=ut Output only. The time when the zone was created. description=amet. Optional. Description of the zone. discovery-spec.csv-options delimiter=gubergren Optional. The delimiter being used to separate values. This defaults to ','. disable-type-inference=true Optional. Whether to disable the inference of data type for CSV data. If true, all columns will be registered as strings. encoding=rebum. Optional. The character encoding of the data. The default is UTF-8. header-rows=55 Optional. The number of rows to interpret as header rows that should be skipped when reading data rows. .. enabled=false Required. Whether discovery is enabled. exclude-patterns=amet. Optional. The list of patterns to apply for selecting data to exclude during discovery. For Cloud Storage bucket assets, these are interpreted as glob patterns used to match object names. For BigQuery dataset assets, these are interpreted as patterns to match table names. Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. include-patterns=kasd Optional. The list of patterns to apply for selecting data to include during discovery if only a subset of the data should considered. For Cloud Storage bucket assets, these are interpreted as glob patterns used to match object names. For BigQuery dataset assets, these are interpreted as patterns to match table names. Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. json-options disable-type-inference=false Optional. Whether to disable the inference of data type for Json data.

The type of the zone. uid=invidunt Output only. System generated globally unique ID for the zone. This ID will be different if the zone is deleted and re-created with the same name. update-time=elitr Output only. The time when the zone was last updated. About Cursors The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. . Each additional . moves it up one additional level. E.g. ... would go three levels up. Optional Output Flags The method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default. -o out out specifies the destination to which to write the server's result to. It will be a JSON-encoded structure. The destination may be - to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes. If unset, it defaults to standard output.
