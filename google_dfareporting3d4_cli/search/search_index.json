By default all output is printed to standard out, but flags can be set to direct it into a file independent of your shell's capabilities. Errors will be printed to standard error, and cause the program's exit code to be non-zero. If data-structures are requested, these will be returned as pretty-printed JSON, to be useful as input to other tools. Everything else about the Dfareporting API can be found at the official documentation site . Installation and Source Code Install the command-line interface with cargo using: cargo install google-dfareporting3d4-cli Find the source code on github . Usage This documentation was generated from the Dfareporting API at revision 20230118 .

Each scope requires the user to grant this application permission to use it. If unset, it defaults to the shortest scope url for a particular method. --config-dir <folder> A directory into which we will store our persistent data. Defaults to a user-writable directory that we will create during the first invocation. [default: ~/.google-service-cli] Configuration The program will store all persistent data in the ~/.google-service-cli directory in JSON files prefixed with dfareporting3d4- . You can change the directory used to store configuration with the --config-dir flag on a per-invocation basis. More information about the various kinds of persistent data are given in the following paragraphs. Authentication Most APIs require a user to authenticate any request. If this is the case, the scope determines the set of permissions granted. The granularity of these is usually no more than read-only or full-access . If not set, the system will automatically select the smallest feasible scope, e.g. when invoking a method that is read-only, it will ask only for a read-only scope. You may use the --scope flag to specify a scope directly. All applicable scopes are documented in the respective method's CLI documentation. The first time a scope is used, the user is asked for permission. Follow the instructions given by the CLI to grant permissions, or to decline. If a scope was authenticated by the user, the respective information will be stored as JSON in the configuration directory, e.g. ~/.google-service-cli/dfareporting3d4-token-<scope-hash>.json . No manual management of these tokens is necessary. To revoke granted authentication, please refer to the official documentation . Application Secrets In order to allow any application to use Google services, it will need to be registered using the Google Developer Console . APIs the application may use are then enabled for it one by one. Most APIs can be used for free and have a daily quota. To allow more comfortable usage of the CLI without forcing anyone to register an own application, the CLI comes with a default application secret that is configured accordingly. This also means that heavy usage all around the world may deplete the daily quota. You can workaround this limitation by putting your own secrets file at this location: ~/.google-service-cli/dfareporting3d4-secret.json , assuming that the required dfareporting API was enabled for it. Such a secret file can be downloaded in the Google Developer Console at APIs & auth -> Credentials -> Download JSON and used as is. Learn more about how to setup Google projects and enable APIs using the official documentation . Debugging Even though the CLI does its best to provide usable error messages, sometimes it might be desirable to know what exactly led to a particular issue. This is done by allowing all client-server communication to be output to standard error as-is . The --debug flag will print errors using the Debug representation to standard error. You may consider redirecting standard error into a file for ease of use, e.g. dfareporting3d4 --debug <resource> <method> [options] 2>debug.txt .","title":"Home"},{"location":"#installation-and-source-code","text":"Install the command-line interface with cargo using: cargo install google-dfareporting3d4-cli Find the source code on github .","title":"Installation and Source Code"},{"location":"#usage","text":"This documentation was generated from the Dfareporting API at revision 20230118 .

If this is the case, the scope determines the set of permissions granted. The granularity of these is usually no more than read-only or full-access . If not set, the system will automatically select the smallest feasible scope, e.g. when invoking a method that is read-only, it will ask only for a read-only scope. You may use the --scope flag to specify a scope directly. All applicable scopes are documented in the respective method's CLI documentation. The first time a scope is used, the user is asked for permission. Follow the instructions given by the CLI to grant permissions, or to decline. If a scope was authenticated by the user, the respective information will be stored as JSON in the configuration directory, e.g. ~/.google-service-cli/dfareporting3d4-token-<scope-hash>.json .

To allow more comfortable usage of the CLI without forcing anyone to register an own application, the CLI comes with a default application secret that is configured accordingly. This also means that heavy usage all around the world may deplete the daily quota. You can workaround this limitation by putting your own secrets file at this location: ~/.google-service-cli/dfareporting3d4-secret.json , assuming that the required dfareporting API was enabled for it.

Required Scalar Arguments <profile-id> (string) User profile ID associated with this request. <id> (string) AdvertiserGroup ID. Required Request Value The request value is a data-structure with various fields. Each field may be a simple scalar or another data-structure. In the latter case it is advised to set the field-cursor to the data-structure's field to specify values more concisely. For example, a structure like this: AdvertiserGroup: account-id: string id: string kind: string name: string can be set completely with the following arguments which are assumed to be executed in the given order. Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time. -r . account-id=rebum. Account ID of this advertiser group. This is a read-only field that can be left blank. id=sea ID of this advertiser group. This is a read-only, auto-generated field. kind=ipsum Identifies what kind of resource this is. Value: the fixed string \"dfareporting#advertiserGroup\". name=ipsum Name of this advertiser group. This is a required field and must be less than 256 characters long and unique among advertiser groups of the same account. About Cursors The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. .

Required Scalar Argument <profile-id> (string) User profile ID associated with this request. Required Request Value The request value is a data-structure with various fields. Each field may be a simple scalar or another data-structure. In the latter case it is advised to set the field-cursor to the data-structure's field to specify values more concisely. For example, a structure like this: ContentCategory: account-id: string id: string kind: string name: string can be set completely with the following arguments which are assumed to be executed in the given order. Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time. -r . account-id=ea Account ID of this content category. This is a read-only field that can be left blank. id=sea ID of this content category. This is a read-only, auto-generated field. kind=dolore Identifies what kind of resource this is. Value: the fixed string \"dfareporting#contentCategory\". name=dolores Name of this content category. This is a required field and must be less than 256 characters long and unique among content categories of the same account. About Cursors The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. .

About Cursors The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. . Each additional . moves it up one additional level. E.g. ... would go three levels up.

If left blank, the tag format will default to HTML. tag-string=sed Value of the cat= parameter in the floodlight tag, which the ad servers use to identify the activity. This is optional: if empty, a new tag string will be generated for you. This string must be 1 to 8 characters long, with valid characters being a-z0-9[ _ ]. This tag string must also be unique among activities of the same activity group. This field is read-only after insertion. user-defined-variable-types=dolor List of the user-defined variables used by this conversion tag. These map to the \"u[1-100]=\" in the tags. Each of these can have a user defined type. Acceptable values are U1 to U100, inclusive. Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. About Cursors The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. . Each additional . moves it up one additional level. E.g. ... would go three levels up.

This is a read-only field that can be left blank. About Cursors The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. . Each additional . moves it up one additional level. E.g. ... would go three levels up. Optional Output Flags The method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default. -o out out specifies the destination to which to write the server's result to.

This is a read-only field that can be left blank. About Cursors The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. . Each additional . moves it up one additional level. E.g. ... would go three levels up.

The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. . Each additional . moves it up one additional level. E.g. ... would go three levels up.

The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. . Each additional . moves it up one additional level. E.g. ... would go three levels up.

About Cursors The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. . Each additional . moves it up one additional level. E.g. ... would go three levels up. Optional Output Flags The method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default. -o out out specifies the destination to which to write the server's result to.

About Cursors The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. . Each additional . moves it up one additional level. E.g. ... would go three levels up.

About Cursors The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. . Each additional . moves it up one additional level. E.g. ... would go three levels up.

The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. .

In the latter case it is advised to set the field-cursor to the data-structure's field to specify values more concisely. For example, a structure like this: TargetingTemplate: account-id: string advertiser-id: string advertiser-id-dimension-value: dimension-name: string etag: string id: string kind: string match-type: string value: string day-part-targeting: days-of-week: [string] hours-of-day: [integer] user-local-time: boolean geo-targeting: exclude-countries: boolean id: string key-value-targeting-expression: expression: string kind: string list-targeting-expression: expression: string name: string subaccount-id: string can be set completely with the following arguments which are assumed to be executed in the given order. Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time. -r . account-id=clita Account ID of this targeting template. This field, if left unset, will be auto-generated on insert and is read-only after insert. advertiser-id=diam Advertiser ID of this targeting template. This is a required field on insert and is read-only after insert. advertiser-id-dimension-value dimension-name=clita The name of the dimension. etag=ea The eTag of this response for caching purposes. id=et The ID associated with the value if available. kind=sea The kind of resource this is, in this case dfareporting#dimensionValue. match-type=nonumy Determines how the 'value' field is matched when filtering. If not specified, defaults to EXACT. If set to WILDCARD_EXPRESSION, ' ' is allowed as a placeholder for variable length character sequences, and it can be escaped with a backslash. Note, only paid search dimensions ('dfa:paidSearch ') allow a matchType other than EXACT. value=ea The value of the dimension. ..day-part-targeting days-of-week=sadipscing Days of the week when the ad will serve. Acceptable values are: - \"SUNDAY\" - \"MONDAY\" - \"TUESDAY\" - \"WEDNESDAY\" - \"THURSDAY\" - \"FRIDAY\" - \"SATURDAY\" Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. hours-of-day=8 Hours of the day when the ad will serve, where 0 is midnight to 1 AM and 23 is 11 PM to midnight. Can be specified with days of week, in which case the ad would serve during these hours on the specified days. For example if Monday, Wednesday, Friday are the days of week specified and 9-10am, 3-5pm (hours 9, 15, and 16) is specified, the ad would serve Monday, Wednesdays, and Fridays at 9-10am and 3-5pm. Acceptable values are 0 to 23, inclusive. Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. user-local-time=true Whether or not to use the user's local time. If false, the America/New York time zone applies. ..geo-targeting exclude-countries=true Whether or not to exclude the countries in the countries field from targeting. If false, the countries field refers to countries which will be targeted by the ad. .. id=voluptua. ID of this targeting template. This is a read-only, auto-generated field. key-value-targeting-expression expression=lorem Keyword expression being targeted by the ad. .. kind=diam Identifies what kind of resource this is. Value: the fixed string \"dfareporting#targetingTemplate\". list-targeting-expression expression=erat Expression describing which lists are being targeted by the ad. .. name=takimata Name of this targeting template. This field is required. It must be less than 256 characters long and unique within an advertiser. subaccount-id=ut Subaccount ID of this targeting template. This field, if left unset, will be auto-generated on insert and is read-only after insert. About Cursors The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. . Each additional . moves it up one additional level. E.g. ... would go three levels up. Optional Output Flags The method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default. -o out out specifies the destination to which to write the server's result to. It will be a JSON-encoded structure. The destination may be - to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes. If unset, it defaults to standard output.

Each field may be a simple scalar or another data-structure. In the latter case it is advised to set the field-cursor to the data-structure's field to specify values more concisely. For example, a structure like this: UserRole: account-id: string default-user-role: boolean id: string kind: string name: string parent-user-role-id: string subaccount-id: string can be set completely with the following arguments which are assumed to be executed in the given order.

This is a read-only field that can be left blank. default-user-role=false Whether this is a default user role.

This is a required field. subaccount-id=justo Subaccount ID of this user role. This is a read-only field that can be left blank. About Cursors The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. .
