By default all output is printed to standard out, but flags can be set to direct it into a file independent of your shell's capabilities. Errors will be printed to standard error, and cause the program's exit code to be non-zero. If data-structures are requested, these will be returned as pretty-printed JSON, to be useful as input to other tools. Everything else about the Speech API can be found at the official documentation site . Installation and Source Code Install the command-line interface with cargo using: cargo install google-speech1-cli Find the source code on github .

Each scope requires the user to grant this application permission to use it. If unset, it defaults to the shortest scope url for a particular method. --config-dir <folder> A directory into which we will store our persistent data. Defaults to a user-writable directory that we will create during the first invocation. [default: ~/.google-service-cli] Configuration The program will store all persistent data in the ~/.google-service-cli directory in JSON files prefixed with speech1- . You can change the directory used to store configuration with the --config-dir flag on a per-invocation basis. More information about the various kinds of persistent data are given in the following paragraphs. Authentication Most APIs require a user to authenticate any request. If this is the case, the scope determines the set of permissions granted. The granularity of these is usually no more than read-only or full-access . If not set, the system will automatically select the smallest feasible scope, e.g. when invoking a method that is read-only, it will ask only for a read-only scope. You may use the --scope flag to specify a scope directly. All applicable scopes are documented in the respective method's CLI documentation. The first time a scope is used, the user is asked for permission. Follow the instructions given by the CLI to grant permissions, or to decline. If a scope was authenticated by the user, the respective information will be stored as JSON in the configuration directory, e.g. ~/.google-service-cli/speech1-token-<scope-hash>.json . No manual management of these tokens is necessary. To revoke granted authentication, please refer to the official documentation . Application Secrets In order to allow any application to use Google services, it will need to be registered using the Google Developer Console . APIs the application may use are then enabled for it one by one. Most APIs can be used for free and have a daily quota. To allow more comfortable usage of the CLI without forcing anyone to register an own application, the CLI comes with a default application secret that is configured accordingly. This also means that heavy usage all around the world may deplete the daily quota. You can workaround this limitation by putting your own secrets file at this location: ~/.google-service-cli/speech1-secret.json , assuming that the required speech API was enabled for it. Such a secret file can be downloaded in the Google Developer Console at APIs & auth -> Credentials -> Download JSON and used as is. Learn more about how to setup Google projects and enable APIs using the official documentation . Debugging Even though the CLI does its best to provide usable error messages, sometimes it might be desirable to know what exactly led to a particular issue. This is done by allowing all client-server communication to be output to standard error as-is . The --debug flag will print errors using the Debug representation to standard error. You may consider redirecting standard error into a file for ease of use, e.g. speech1 --debug <resource> <method> [options] 2>debug.txt .","title":"Home"},{"location":"#installation-and-source-code","text":"Install the command-line interface with cargo using: cargo install google-speech1-cli Find the source code on github .","title":"Installation and Source Code"},{"location":"#usage","text":"This documentation was generated from the Speech API at revision 20240222 .

If you are calling the speech.googleapis.com endpoint, use the global location. To specify a region, use a regional endpoint with matching us or eu location value. Required Request Value The request value is a data-structure with various fields. Each field may be a simple scalar or another data-structure. In the latter case it is advised to set the field-cursor to the data-structure's field to specify values more concisely. For example, a structure like this: CreateCustomClassRequest: custom-class: annotations: { string: string } custom-class-id: string delete-time: string display-name: string etag: string expire-time: string kms-key-name: string kms-key-version-name: string name: string reconciling: boolean state: string uid: string custom-class-id: string can be set completely with the following arguments which are assumed to be executed in the given order. Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time. -r .custom-class annotations=key=et Output only. Allows users to store small amounts of arbitrary data. Both the key and the value must be 63 characters or less each. At most 100 annotations. This field is not used. the value will be associated with the given key custom-class-id=magna If this custom class is a resource, the custom_class_id is the resource id of the CustomClass. Case sensitive. delete-time=no Output only. The time at which this resource was requested for deletion. This field is not used. display-name=ipsum Output only. User-settable, human-readable name for the CustomClass. Must be 63 characters or less. This field is not used. etag=voluptua. Output only. This checksum is computed by the server based on the value of other fields. This may be sent on update, undelete, and delete requests to ensure the client has an up-to-date value before proceeding.

About Cursors The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. . Each additional . moves it up one additional level. E.g. ... would go three levels up. Optional Output Flags The method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default. -o out out specifies the destination to which to write the server's result to.

Which model to select for the given request. Select the model best suited to your domain to get best results. If a model is not explicitly specified, then we auto-select a model based on the parameters in the RecognitionConfig. Model Description latest_long Best for long form content like media or conversation. latest_short Best for short form content like commands or single shot directed speech. command_and_search Best for short queries such as voice commands or voice search. phone_call Best for audio that originated from a phone call (typically recorded at an 8khz sampling rate). video Best for audio that originated from video or includes multiple speakers. Ideally the audio is recorded at a 16khz or greater sampling rate. This is a premium model that costs more than the standard rate. default Best for audio that is not one of the specific audio models. For example, long-form audio. Ideally the audio is high-fidelity, recorded at a 16khz or greater sampling rate. medical_conversation Best for audio that originated from a conversation between a medical provider and patient. medical_dictation Best for audio that originated from dictation notes by a medical provider. profanity-filter=false If set to true , the server will attempt to filter out profanities, replacing all but the initial character in each filtered word with asterisks, e.g. \"f***\". If set to false or omitted, profanities won't be filtered out. sample-rate-hertz=99 Sample rate in Hertz of the audio data sent in all RecognitionAudio messages. Valid values are: 8000-48000. 16000 is optimal. For best results, set the sampling rate of the audio source to 16000 Hz. If that's not possible, use the native sample rate of the audio source (instead of re-sampling). This field is optional for FLAC and WAV audio files, but is required for all other audio formats. For details, see AudioEncoding. use-enhanced=false Set to true to use an enhanced model for speech recognition. If use_enhanced is set to true and the model field is not set, then an appropriate enhanced model is chosen if an enhanced model exists for the audio. If use_enhanced is true and an enhanced version of the specified model does not exist, then the speech is recognized using the standard version of the specified model. ..output-config gcs-uri=lorem Specifies a Cloud Storage URI for the recognition results. Must be specified in the format: gs://bucket_name/object_name , and the bucket must already exist. About Cursors The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. . Each additional . moves it up one additional level. E.g. ... would go three levels up. Optional Output Flags The method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default. -o out out specifies the destination to which to write the server's result to. It will be a JSON-encoded structure. The destination may be - to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes. If unset, it defaults to standard output. Optional General Properties The following properties can configure any call, and are not specific to this method. -p $-xgafv=string V1 error format. -p access-token=string OAuth access token. -p alt=string Data format for response. -p callback=string JSONP -p fields=string Selector specifying which fields to include in a partial response. -p key=string API key.

Select the model best suited to your domain to get best results. If a model is not explicitly specified, then we auto-select a model based on the parameters in the RecognitionConfig. Model Description latest_long Best for long form content like media or conversation. latest_short Best for short form content like commands or single shot directed speech. command_and_search Best for short queries such as voice commands or voice search. phone_call Best for audio that originated from a phone call (typically recorded at an 8khz sampling rate). video Best for audio that originated from video or includes multiple speakers. Ideally the audio is recorded at a 16khz or greater sampling rate. This is a premium model that costs more than the standard rate. default Best for audio that is not one of the specific audio models. For example, long-form audio. Ideally the audio is high-fidelity, recorded at a 16khz or greater sampling rate. medical_conversation Best for audio that originated from a conversation between a medical provider and patient. medical_dictation Best for audio that originated from dictation notes by a medical provider. profanity-filter=false If set to true , the server will attempt to filter out profanities, replacing all but the initial character in each filtered word with asterisks, e.g. \"f***\". If set to false or omitted, profanities won't be filtered out. sample-rate-hertz=55 Sample rate in Hertz of the audio data sent in all RecognitionAudio messages. Valid values are: 8000-48000. 16000 is optimal. For best results, set the sampling rate of the audio source to 16000 Hz. If that's not possible, use the native sample rate of the audio source (instead of re-sampling). This field is optional for FLAC and WAV audio files, but is required for all other audio formats. For details, see AudioEncoding. use-enhanced=true Set to true to use an enhanced model for speech recognition. If use_enhanced is set to true and the model field is not set, then an appropriate enhanced model is chosen if an enhanced model exists for the audio. If use_enhanced is true and an enhanced version of the specified model does not exist, then the speech is recognized using the standard version of the specified model. About Cursors The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. . Each additional . moves it up one additional level. E.g. ... would go three levels up. Optional Output Flags The method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default. -o out out specifies the destination to which to write the server's result to. It will be a JSON-encoded structure. The destination may be - to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes. If unset, it defaults to standard output. Optional General Properties The following properties can configure any call, and are not specific to this method. -p $-xgafv=string V1 error format. -p access-token=string OAuth access token. -p alt=string Data format for response. -p callback=string JSONP -p fields=string Selector specifying which fields to include in a partial response. -p key=string API key. Your API key identifies your project and provides you with API access, quota, and reports. Required unless you provide an OAuth 2.0 token. -p oauth-token=string OAuth 2.0 token for the current user. -p pretty-print=boolean Returns response with indentations and line breaks. -p quota-user=string Available to use for quota purposes for server-side applications. Can be any arbitrary string assigned to a user, but should not exceed 40 characters. -p upload-type=string Legacy upload protocol for media (e.g. \"media\", \"multipart\"). -p upload-protocol=string Upload protocol for media (e.g. \"raw\", \"multipart\").","title":"Recognize"},{"location":"speech_recognize/#scopes","text":"You will need authorization for the https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform scope to make a valid call.

Each field may be a simple scalar or another data-structure. In the latter case it is advised to set the field-cursor to the data-structure's field to specify values more concisely. For example, a structure like this: RecognizeRequest: audio: content: string uri: string config: adaptation: abnf-grammar: abnf-strings: [string] phrase-set-references: [string] alternative-language-codes: [string] audio-channel-count: integer diarization-config: enable-speaker-diarization: boolean max-speaker-count: integer min-speaker-count: integer speaker-tag: integer enable-automatic-punctuation: boolean enable-separate-recognition-per-channel: boolean enable-spoken-emojis: boolean enable-spoken-punctuation: boolean enable-word-confidence: boolean enable-word-time-offsets: boolean encoding: string language-code: string max-alternatives: integer metadata: audio-topic: string industry-naics-code-of-audio: integer interaction-type: string microphone-distance: string original-media-type: string original-mime-type: string recording-device-name: string recording-device-type: string model: string profanity-filter: boolean sample-rate-hertz: integer use-enhanced: boolean can be set completely with the following arguments which are assumed to be executed in the given order. Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time. -r .audio content=invidunt The audio data bytes encoded as specified in RecognitionConfig . Note: as with all bytes fields, proto buffers use a pure binary representation, whereas JSON representations use base64. uri=no URI that points to a file that contains audio data bytes as specified in RecognitionConfig . The file must not be compressed (for example, gzip). Currently, only Google Cloud Storage URIs are supported, which must be specified in the following format: gs://bucket_name/object_name (other URI formats return google.rpc.Code.INVALID_ARGUMENT). For more information, see Request URIs . ..config.adaptation.abnf-grammar abnf-strings=est All declarations and rules of an ABNF grammar broken up into multiple strings that will end up concatenated. Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. .. phrase-set-references=at A collection of phrase set resource names to use. Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. .. alternative-language-codes=sed A list of up to 3 additional BCP-47 language tags, listing possible alternative languages of the supplied audio. See Language Support for a list of the currently supported language codes. If alternative languages are listed, recognition result will contain recognition in the most likely language detected including the main language_code. The recognition result will include the language tag of the language detected in the audio. Note: This feature is only supported for Voice Command and Voice Search use cases and performance may vary for other use cases (e.g., phone call transcription). Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. audio-channel-count=3 The number of channels in the input audio data. ONLY set this for MULTI-CHANNEL recognition. Valid values for LINEAR16, OGG_OPUS and FLAC are 1 - 8 . Valid value for MULAW, AMR, AMR_WB and SPEEX_WITH_HEADER_BYTE is only 1 . If 0 or omitted, defaults to one channel (mono). Note: We only recognize the first channel by default. To perform independent recognition on each channel set enable_separate_recognition_per_channel to 'true'. diarization-config enable-speaker-diarization=true If 'true', enables speaker detection for each recognized word in the top alternative of the recognition result using a speaker_label provided in the WordInfo. max-speaker-count=69 Maximum number of speakers in the conversation. This range gives you more flexibility by allowing the system to automatically determine the correct number of speakers. If not set, the default value is 6. min-speaker-count=96 Minimum number of speakers in the conversation. This range gives you more flexibility by allowing the system to automatically determine the correct number of speakers. If not set, the default value is 2. speaker-tag=83 Output only. Unused. .. enable-automatic-punctuation=true If 'true', adds punctuation to recognition result hypotheses. This feature is only available in select languages. Setting this for requests in other languages has no effect at all. The default 'false' value does not add punctuation to result hypotheses. enable-separate-recognition-per-channel=true This needs to be set to true explicitly and audio_channel_count > 1 to get each channel recognized separately. The recognition result will contain a channel_tag field to state which channel that result belongs to. If this is not true, we will only recognize the first channel. The request is billed cumulatively for all channels recognized: audio_channel_count multiplied by the length of the audio. enable-spoken-emojis=true The spoken emoji behavior for the call If not set, uses default behavior based on model of choice If 'true', adds spoken emoji formatting for the request. This will replace spoken emojis with the corresponding Unicode symbols in the final transcript. If 'false', spoken emojis are not replaced. enable-spoken-punctuation=false The spoken punctuation behavior for the call If not set, uses default behavior based on model of choice e.g. command_and_search will enable spoken punctuation by default If 'true', replaces spoken punctuation with the corresponding symbols in the request. For example, \"how are you question mark\" becomes \"how are you?\". See https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-text/docs/spoken-punctuation for support. If 'false', spoken punctuation is not replaced. enable-word-confidence=false If true , the top result includes a list of words and the confidence for those words. If false , no word-level confidence information is returned. The default is false . enable-word-time-offsets=false If true , the top result includes a list of words and the start and end time offsets (timestamps) for those words. If false , no word-level time offset information is returned. The default is false . encoding=sed Encoding of audio data sent in all RecognitionAudio messages. This field is optional for FLAC and WAV audio files and required for all other audio formats. For details, see AudioEncoding. language-code=no Required. The language of the supplied audio as a BCP-47 language tag. Example: \"en-US\". See Language Support for a list of the currently supported language codes. max-alternatives=10 Maximum number of recognition hypotheses to be returned. Specifically, the maximum number of SpeechRecognitionAlternative messages within each SpeechRecognitionResult . The server may return fewer than max_alternatives . Valid values are 0 - 30 . A value of 0 or 1 will return a maximum of one. If omitted, will return a maximum of one. metadata audio-topic=at Description of the content. Eg. \"Recordings of federal supreme court hearings from 2012\". industry-naics-code-of-audio=56 The industry vertical to which this speech recognition request most closely applies. This is most indicative of the topics contained in the audio. Use the 6-digit NAICS code to identify the industry vertical - see https://www.naics.com/search/. interaction-type=aliquyam The use case most closely describing the audio content to be recognized. microphone-distance=dolores The audio type that most closely describes the audio being recognized. original-media-type=sadipscing The original media the speech was recorded on. original-mime-type=erat Mime type of the original audio file.
