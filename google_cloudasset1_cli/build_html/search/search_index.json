By default all output is printed to standard out, but flags can be set to direct it into a file independent of your shell's capabilities. Errors will be printed to standard error, and cause the program's exit code to be non-zero. If data-structures are requested, these will be returned as pretty-printed JSON, to be useful as input to other tools. Everything else about the Cloud Asset API can be found at the official documentation site . Installation and Source Code Install the command-line interface with cargo using: cargo install google-cloudasset1-cli Find the source code on github .

Defaults to a user-writable directory that we will create during the first invocation. [default: ~/.google-service-cli] Configuration The program will store all persistent data in the ~/.google-service-cli directory in JSON files prefixed with cloudasset1- . You can change the directory used to store configuration with the --config-dir flag on a per-invocation basis. More information about the various kinds of persistent data are given in the following paragraphs. Authentication Most APIs require a user to authenticate any request. If this is the case, the scope determines the set of permissions granted. The granularity of these is usually no more than read-only or full-access . If not set, the system will automatically select the smallest feasible scope, e.g. when invoking a method that is read-only, it will ask only for a read-only scope. You may use the --scope flag to specify a scope directly. All applicable scopes are documented in the respective method's CLI documentation. The first time a scope is used, the user is asked for permission. Follow the instructions given by the CLI to grant permissions, or to decline. If a scope was authenticated by the user, the respective information will be stored as JSON in the configuration directory, e.g. ~/.google-service-cli/cloudasset1-token-<scope-hash>.json . No manual management of these tokens is necessary. To revoke granted authentication, please refer to the official documentation . Application Secrets In order to allow any application to use Google services, it will need to be registered using the Google Developer Console . APIs the application may use are then enabled for it one by one. Most APIs can be used for free and have a daily quota. To allow more comfortable usage of the CLI without forcing anyone to register an own application, the CLI comes with a default application secret that is configured accordingly. This also means that heavy usage all around the world may deplete the daily quota. You can workaround this limitation by putting your own secrets file at this location: ~/.google-service-cli/cloudasset1-secret.json , assuming that the required cloudasset API was enabled for it. Such a secret file can be downloaded in the Google Developer Console at APIs & auth -> Credentials -> Download JSON and used as is. Learn more about how to setup Google projects and enable APIs using the official documentation . Debugging Even though the CLI does its best to provide usable error messages, sometimes it might be desirable to know what exactly led to a particular issue. This is done by allowing all client-server communication to be output to standard error as-is . The --debug flag will print errors using the Debug representation to standard error. You may consider redirecting standard error into a file for ease of use, e.g. cloudasset1 --debug <resource> <method> [options] 2>debug.txt .","title":"Home"},{"location":"#installation-and-source-code","text":"Install the command-line interface with cargo using: cargo install google-cloudasset1-cli Find the source code on github .","title":"Installation and Source Code"},{"location":"#usage","text":"This documentation was generated from the Cloud Asset API at revision 20240302 .

Required Request Value The request value is a data-structure with various fields. Each field may be a simple scalar or another data-structure. In the latter case it is advised to set the field-cursor to the data-structure's field to specify values more concisely. For example, a structure like this: CreateFeedRequest: feed: asset-names: [string] asset-types: [string] condition: description: string expression: string location: string title: string content-type: string feed-output-config: pubsub-destination: topic: string name: string relationship-types: [string] feed-id: string can be set completely with the following arguments which are assumed to be executed in the given order. Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time. -r .feed asset-names=et A list of the full names of the assets to receive updates. You must specify either or both of asset_names and asset_types. Only asset updates matching specified asset_names or asset_types are exported to the feed. Example: //compute.googleapis.com/projects/my_project_123/zones/zone1/instances/instance1 . For a list of the full names for supported asset types, see Resource name format . Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. asset-types=magna A list of types of the assets to receive updates. You must specify either or both of asset_names and asset_types. Only asset updates matching specified asset_names or asset_types are exported to the feed. Example: &#34;compute.googleapis.com/Disk&#34; For a list of all supported asset types, see Supported asset types . Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. condition description=no Optional. Description of the expression. This is a longer text which describes the expression, e.g. when hovered over it in a UI. expression=ipsum Textual representation of an expression in Common Expression Language syntax. location=voluptua. Optional. String indicating the location of the expression for error reporting, e.g. a file name and a position in the file. title=at Optional. Title for the expression, i.e. a short string describing its purpose. This can be used e.g. in UIs which allow to enter the expression. .. content-type=sanctus Asset content type. If not specified, no content but the asset name and type will be returned. feed-output-config.pubsub-destination topic=sed The name of the Pub/Sub topic to publish to. Example: projects/PROJECT_ID/topics/TOPIC_ID . ... name=amet. Required. The format will be projects/{project_number}/feeds/{client-assigned_feed_identifier} or folders/{folder_number}/feeds/{client-assigned_feed_identifier} or organizations/{organization_number}/feeds/{client-assigned_feed_identifier} The client-assigned feed identifier must be unique within the parent project/folder/organization. relationship-types=takimata A list of relationship types to output, for example: INSTANCE_TO_INSTANCEGROUP . This field should only be specified if content_type=RELATIONSHIP. * If specified: it outputs specified relationship updates on the [asset_names] or the [asset_types].

See Introduction to Cloud Asset Inventory for all supported asset types and relationship types. Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. .. feed-id=amet. Required. This is the client-assigned asset feed identifier and it needs to be unique under a specific parent project/folder/organization. About Cursors The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. . Each additional . moves it up one additional level. E.g. ... would go three levels up. Optional Output Flags The method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default. -o out out specifies the destination to which to write the server's result to. It will be a JSON-encoded structure. The destination may be - to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes. If unset, it defaults to standard output.

You can set the scope for this method like this: cloudasset1 --scope <scope> methods analyze-iam-policy-longrunning ... Required Scalar Argument <scope> (string) Required. The relative name of the root asset. Only resources and IAM policies within the scope will be analyzed. This can only be an organization number (such as \"organizations/123\"), a folder number (such as \"folders/123\"), a project ID (such as \"projects/my-project-id\"), or a project number (such as \"projects/12345\"). To know how to get organization ID, visit here . To know how to get folder or project ID, visit here . Required Request Value The request value is a data-structure with various fields. Each field may be a simple scalar or another data-structure. In the latter case it is advised to set the field-cursor to the data-structure's field to specify values more concisely. For example, a structure like this: AnalyzeIamPolicyLongrunningRequest: analysis-query: access-selector: permissions: [string] roles: [string] condition-context: access-time: string identity-selector: identity: string options: analyze-service-account-impersonation: boolean expand-groups: boolean expand-resources: boolean expand-roles: boolean output-group-edges: boolean output-resource-edges: boolean resource-selector: full-resource-name: string scope: string output-config: bigquery-destination: dataset: string partition-key: string table-prefix: string write-disposition: string gcs-destination: uri: string saved-analysis-query: string can be set completely with the following arguments which are assumed to be executed in the given order. Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time. -r .analysis-query.access-selector permissions=duo Optional. The permissions to appear in result. Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. roles=ipsum Optional. The roles to appear in result. Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. ..condition-context access-time=sed The hypothetical access timestamp to evaluate IAM conditions. Note that this value must not be earlier than the current time; otherwise, an INVALID_ARGUMENT error will be returned. ..identity-selector identity=ut Required. The identity appear in the form of principals in IAM policy binding . The examples of supported forms are: \"user:mike@example.com\", \"group:admins@example.com\", \"domain:google.com\", \"serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com\". Notice that wildcard characters (such as * and ?) are not supported. You must give a specific identity. ..options analyze-service-account-impersonation=true Optional. If true, the response will include access analysis from identities to resources via service account impersonation. This is a very expensive operation, because many derived queries will be executed. We highly recommend you use AssetService.AnalyzeIamPolicyLongrunning RPC instead. For example, if the request analyzes for which resources user A has permission P, and there's an IAM policy states user A has iam.serviceAccounts.getAccessToken permission to a service account SA, and there's another IAM policy states service account SA has permission P to a Google Cloud folder F, then user A potentially has access to the Google Cloud folder F. And those advanced analysis results will be included in AnalyzeIamPolicyResponse.service_account_impersonation_analysis. Another example, if the request analyzes for who has permission P to a Google Cloud folder F, and there's an IAM policy states user A has iam.serviceAccounts.actAs permission to a service account SA, and there's another IAM policy states service account SA has permission P to the Google Cloud folder F, then user A potentially has access to the Google Cloud folder F.

If true, the identities section of the result will expand any Google groups appearing in an IAM policy binding. If IamPolicyAnalysisQuery.identity_selector is specified, the identity in the result will be determined by the selector, and this flag is not allowed to set. If true, the default max expansion per group is 1000 for AssetService.AnalyzeIamPolicy][]. Default is false. expand-resources=true Optional. If true and IamPolicyAnalysisQuery.resource_selector is not specified, the resource section of the result will expand any resource attached to an IAM policy to include resources lower in the resource hierarchy. For example, if the request analyzes for which resources user A has permission P, and the results include an IAM policy with P on a Google Cloud folder, the results will also include resources in that folder with permission P. If true and IamPolicyAnalysisQuery.resource_selector is specified, the resource section of the result will expand the specified resource to include resources lower in the resource hierarchy. Only project or lower resources are supported. Folder and organization resources cannot be used together with this option. For example, if the request analyzes for which users have permission P on a Google Cloud project with this option enabled, the results will include all users who have permission P on that project or any lower resource. If true, the default max expansion per resource is 1000 for AssetService.AnalyzeIamPolicy][] and 100000 for AssetService.AnalyzeIamPolicyLongrunning][]. Default is false. expand-roles=true Optional. If true, the access section of result will expand any roles appearing in IAM policy bindings to include their permissions. If IamPolicyAnalysisQuery.access_selector is specified, the access section of the result will be determined by the selector, and this flag is not allowed to set. Default is false. output-group-edges=false Optional. If true, the result will output the relevant membership relationships between groups and other groups, and between groups and principals. Default is false. output-resource-edges=true Optional. If true, the result will output the relevant parent/child relationships between resources. Default is false. ..resource-selector full-resource-name=eos Required. The [full resource name] (https://cloud.google.com/asset-inventory/docs/resource-name-format) of a resource of supported resource types . .. scope=labore Required. The relative name of the root asset. Only resources and IAM policies within the scope will be analyzed. This can only be an organization number (such as \"organizations/123\"), a folder number (such as \"folders/123\"), a project ID (such as \"projects/my-project-id\"), or a project number (such as \"projects/12345\"). To know how to get organization ID, visit here . To know how to get folder or project ID, visit here . ..output-config.bigquery-destination dataset=sed Required. The BigQuery dataset in format \"projects/projectId/datasets/datasetId\", to which the analysis results should be exported. If this dataset does not exist, the export call will return an INVALID_ARGUMENT error. partition-key=duo The partition key for BigQuery partitioned table. table-prefix=sed Required. The prefix of the BigQuery tables to which the analysis results will be written. Tables will be created based on this table_prefix if not exist: * _analysis table will contain export operation's metadata. * _analysis_result will contain all the IamPolicyAnalysisResult. When [partition_key] is specified, both tables will be partitioned based on the [partition_key]. write-disposition=no Optional. Specifies the action that occurs if the destination table or partition already exists. The following values are supported: * WRITE_TRUNCATE: If the table or partition already exists, BigQuery overwrites the entire table or all the partitions data. * WRITE_APPEND: If the table or partition already exists, BigQuery appends the data to the table or the latest partition. * WRITE_EMPTY: If the table already exists and contains data, an error is returned. The default value is WRITE_APPEND. Each action is atomic and only occurs if BigQuery is able to complete the job successfully. Details are at https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/loading-data-local#appending_to_or_overwriting_a_table_using_a_local_file. ..gcs-destination uri=stet Required. The URI of the Cloud Storage object. It's the same URI that is used by gsutil. Example: \"gs://bucket_name/object_name\". See Viewing and Editing Object Metadata for more information. If the specified Cloud Storage object already exists and there is no hold , it will be overwritten with the analysis result. ... saved-analysis-query=kasd Optional. The name of a saved query, which must be in the format of: * projects/project_number/savedQueries/saved_query_id * folders/folder_number/savedQueries/saved_query_id * organizations/organization_number/savedQueries/saved_query_id If both analysis_query and saved_analysis_query are provided, they will be merged together with the saved_analysis_query as base and the analysis_query as overrides. For more details of the merge behavior, refer to the MergeFrom doc. Note that you cannot override primitive fields with default value, such as 0 or empty string, etc., because we use proto3, which doesn't support field presence yet. About Cursors The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. . Each additional . moves it up one additional level. E.g. ... would go three levels up. Optional Output Flags The method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default. -o out out specifies the destination to which to write the server's result to.

Please note that -p is followed by one or more key-value-pairs, and is called like this -p k1=v1 k2=v2 even though the listing below repeats the -p for completeness. -p analysis-query-access-selector-permissions=string Optional. The permissions to appear in result. -p analysis-query-access-selector-roles=string Optional. The roles to appear in result. -p analysis-query-condition-context-access-time=string The hypothetical access timestamp to evaluate IAM conditions. Note that this value must not be earlier than the current time; otherwise, an INVALID_ARGUMENT error will be returned. -p analysis-query-identity-selector-identity=string Required. The identity appear in the form of principals in IAM policy binding . The examples of supported forms are: \"user:mike@example.com\", \"group:admins@example.com\", \"domain:google.com\", \"serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com\". Notice that wildcard characters (such as * and ?) are not supported. You must give a specific identity. -p analysis-query-options-analyze-service-account-impersonation=boolean Optional. If true, the response will include access analysis from identities to resources via service account impersonation. This is a very expensive operation, because many derived queries will be executed. We highly recommend you use AssetService.AnalyzeIamPolicyLongrunning RPC instead. For example, if the request analyzes for which resources user A has permission P, and there's an IAM policy states user A has iam.serviceAccounts.getAccessToken permission to a service account SA, and there's another IAM policy states service account SA has permission P to a Google Cloud folder F, then user A potentially has access to the Google Cloud folder F. And those advanced analysis results will be included in AnalyzeIamPolicyResponse.service_account_impersonation_analysis. Another example, if the request analyzes for who has permission P to a Google Cloud folder F, and there's an IAM policy states user A has iam.serviceAccounts.actAs permission to a service account SA, and there's another IAM policy states service account SA has permission P to the Google Cloud folder F, then user A potentially has access to the Google Cloud folder F. And those advanced analysis results will be included in AnalyzeIamPolicyResponse.service_account_impersonation_analysis. Only the following permissions are considered in this analysis: * iam.serviceAccounts.actAs * iam.serviceAccounts.signBlob * iam.serviceAccounts.signJwt * iam.serviceAccounts.getAccessToken * iam.serviceAccounts.getOpenIdToken * iam.serviceAccounts.implicitDelegation Default is false. -p analysis-query-options-expand-groups=boolean Optional. If true, the identities section of the result will expand any Google groups appearing in an IAM policy binding. If IamPolicyAnalysisQuery.identity_selector is specified, the identity in the result will be determined by the selector, and this flag is not allowed to set. If true, the default max expansion per group is 1000 for AssetService.AnalyzeIamPolicy][]. Default is false. -p analysis-query-options-expand-resources=boolean Optional. If true and IamPolicyAnalysisQuery.resource_selector is not specified, the resource section of the result will expand any resource attached to an IAM policy to include resources lower in the resource hierarchy. For example, if the request analyzes for which resources user A has permission P, and the results include an IAM policy with P on a Google Cloud folder, the results will also include resources in that folder with permission P. If true and IamPolicyAnalysisQuery.resource_selector is specified, the resource section of the result will expand the specified resource to include resources lower in the resource hierarchy. Only project or lower resources are supported. Folder and organization resources cannot be used together with this option. For example, if the request analyzes for which users have permission P on a Google Cloud project with this option enabled, the results will include all users who have permission P on that project or any lower resource. If true, the default max expansion per resource is 1000 for AssetService.AnalyzeIamPolicy][] and 100000 for AssetService.AnalyzeIamPolicyLongrunning][]. Default is false. -p analysis-query-options-expand-roles=boolean Optional. If true, the access section of result will expand any roles appearing in IAM policy bindings to include their permissions. If IamPolicyAnalysisQuery.access_selector is specified, the access section of the result will be determined by the selector, and this flag is not allowed to set. Default is false. -p analysis-query-options-output-group-edges=boolean Optional. If true, the result will output the relevant membership relationships between groups and other groups, and between groups and principals. Default is false. -p analysis-query-options-output-resource-edges=boolean Optional. If true, the result will output the relevant parent/child relationships between resources. Default is false. -p analysis-query-resource-selector-full-resource-name=string Required. The [full resource name] (https://cloud.google.com/asset-inventory/docs/resource-name-format) of a resource of supported resource types . -p execution-timeout=string Optional. Amount of time executable has to complete. See JSON representation of Duration . If this field is set with a value less than the RPC deadline, and the execution of your query hasn't finished in the specified execution timeout, you will get a response with partial result. Otherwise, your query's execution will continue until the RPC deadline. If it's not finished until then, you will get a DEADLINE_EXCEEDED error. Default is empty. -p saved-analysis-query=string Optional. The name of a saved query, which must be in the format of: * projects/project_number/savedQueries/saved_query_id * folders/folder_number/savedQueries/saved_query_id * organizations/organization_number/savedQueries/saved_query_id If both analysis_query and saved_analysis_query are provided, they will be merged together with the saved_analysis_query as base and the analysis_query as overrides.

Example: if field [table] is \"mytable\" and snapshot results contain \"storage.googleapis.com/Bucket\" assets, the corresponding table name will be \"mytable_storage_googleapis_com_Bucket\". If any of these tables does not exist, a new table with the concatenated name will be created.

The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. .

For example, a structure like this: QueryAssetsRequest: job-reference: string output-config: bigquery-destination: dataset: string table: string write-disposition: string page-size: integer page-token: string read-time: string read-time-window: end-time: string start-time: string statement: string timeout: string can be set completely with the following arguments which are assumed to be executed in the given order. Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time. -r . job-reference=consetetur Optional. Reference to the query job, which is from the QueryAssetsResponse of previous QueryAssets call. output-config.bigquery-destination dataset=diam Required. The BigQuery dataset where the query results will be saved. It has the format of \"projects/{projectId}/datasets/{datasetId}\". table=dolor Required. The BigQuery table where the query results will be saved. If this table does not exist, a new table with the given name will be created. write-disposition=et Specifies the action that occurs if the destination table or partition already exists. The following values are supported: * WRITE_TRUNCATE: If the table or partition already exists, BigQuery overwrites the entire table or all the partitions data. * WRITE_APPEND: If the table or partition already exists, BigQuery appends the data to the table or the latest partition. * WRITE_EMPTY: If the table already exists and contains data, a 'duplicate' error is returned in the job result. The default value is WRITE_EMPTY. ... page-size=79 Optional. The maximum number of rows to return in the results. Responses are limited to 10 MB and 1000 rows. By default, the maximum row count is 1000. When the byte or row count limit is reached, the rest of the query results will be paginated. The field will be ignored when [output_config] is specified. page-token=sadipscing Optional. A page token received from previous QueryAssets . The field will be ignored when [output_config] is specified. read-time=stet Optional. Queries cloud assets as they appeared at the specified point in time. read-time-window end-time=dolor End time of the time window (inclusive). If not specified, the current timestamp is used instead. start-time=duo Start time of the time window (exclusive). .. statement=vero Optional. A SQL statement that's compatible with BigQuery SQL . timeout=vero Optional. Specifies the maximum amount of time that the client is willing to wait for the query to complete. By default, this limit is 5 min for the first query, and 1 minute for the following queries. If the query is complete, the done field in the QueryAssetsResponse is true, otherwise false. Like BigQuery jobs.query API The call is not guaranteed to wait for the specified timeout; it typically returns after around 200 seconds (200,000 milliseconds), even if the query is not complete. The field will be ignored when [output_config] is specified. About Cursors The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. . Each additional . moves it up one additional level. E.g. ... would go three levels up. Optional Output Flags The method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default. -o out out specifies the destination to which to write the server's result to. It will be a JSON-encoded structure. The destination may be - to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes. If unset, it defaults to standard output.

Required Request Value The request value is a data-structure with various fields. Each field may be a simple scalar or another data-structure. In the latter case it is advised to set the field-cursor to the data-structure's field to specify values more concisely. For example, a structure like this: SavedQuery: content: iam-policy-analysis-query: access-selector: permissions: [string] roles: [string] condition-context: access-time: string identity-selector: identity: string options: analyze-service-account-impersonation: boolean expand-groups: boolean expand-resources: boolean expand-roles: boolean output-group-edges: boolean output-resource-edges: boolean resource-selector: full-resource-name: string scope: string create-time: string creator: string description: string labels: { string: string } last-update-time: string last-updater: string name: string can be set completely with the following arguments which are assumed to be executed in the given order. Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time. -r .content.iam-policy-analysis-query.access-selector permissions=invidunt Optional. The permissions to appear in result. Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. roles=stet Optional. The roles to appear in result. Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. ..condition-context access-time=vero The hypothetical access timestamp to evaluate IAM conditions. Note that this value must not be earlier than the current time; otherwise, an INVALID_ARGUMENT error will be returned. ..identity-selector identity=elitr Required. The identity appear in the form of principals in IAM policy binding . The examples of supported forms are: \"user:mike@example.com\", \"group:admins@example.com\", \"domain:google.com\", \"serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com\". Notice that wildcard characters (such as * and ?) are not supported. You must give a specific identity. ..options analyze-service-account-impersonation=true Optional. If true, the response will include access analysis from identities to resources via service account impersonation. This is a very expensive operation, because many derived queries will be executed. We highly recommend you use AssetService.AnalyzeIamPolicyLongrunning RPC instead. For example, if the request analyzes for which resources user A has permission P, and there's an IAM policy states user A has iam.serviceAccounts.getAccessToken permission to a service account SA, and there's another IAM policy states service account SA has permission P to a Google Cloud folder F, then user A potentially has access to the Google Cloud folder F.

If true, the identities section of the result will expand any Google groups appearing in an IAM policy binding. If IamPolicyAnalysisQuery.identity_selector is specified, the identity in the result will be determined by the selector, and this flag is not allowed to set. If true, the default max expansion per group is 1000 for AssetService.AnalyzeIamPolicy][]. Default is false. expand-resources=true Optional. If true and IamPolicyAnalysisQuery.resource_selector is not specified, the resource section of the result will expand any resource attached to an IAM policy to include resources lower in the resource hierarchy. For example, if the request analyzes for which resources user A has permission P, and the results include an IAM policy with P on a Google Cloud folder, the results will also include resources in that folder with permission P. If true and IamPolicyAnalysisQuery.resource_selector is specified, the resource section of the result will expand the specified resource to include resources lower in the resource hierarchy. Only project or lower resources are supported. Folder and organization resources cannot be used together with this option. For example, if the request analyzes for which users have permission P on a Google Cloud project with this option enabled, the results will include all users who have permission P on that project or any lower resource. If true, the default max expansion per resource is 1000 for AssetService.AnalyzeIamPolicy][] and 100000 for AssetService.AnalyzeIamPolicyLongrunning][]. Default is false. expand-roles=true Optional.

The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. . Each additional . moves it up one additional level. E.g. ... would go three levels up. Optional Output Flags The method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default. -o out out specifies the destination to which to write the server's result to. It will be a JSON-encoded structure. The destination may be - to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes. If unset, it defaults to standard output.

The permissions to appear in result. Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. roles=dolore Optional. The roles to appear in result. Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. ..condition-context access-time=voluptua. The hypothetical access timestamp to evaluate IAM conditions. Note that this value must not be earlier than the current time; otherwise, an INVALID_ARGUMENT error will be returned. ..identity-selector identity=amet. Required. The identity appear in the form of principals in IAM policy binding . The examples of supported forms are: \"user:mike@example.com\", \"group:admins@example.com\", \"domain:google.com\", \"serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com\".

If true, the default max expansion per group is 1000 for AssetService.AnalyzeIamPolicy][]. Default is false. expand-resources=true Optional. If true and IamPolicyAnalysisQuery.resource_selector is not specified, the resource section of the result will expand any resource attached to an IAM policy to include resources lower in the resource hierarchy. For example, if the request analyzes for which resources user A has permission P, and the results include an IAM policy with P on a Google Cloud folder, the results will also include resources in that folder with permission P. If true and IamPolicyAnalysisQuery.resource_selector is specified, the resource section of the result will expand the specified resource to include resources lower in the resource hierarchy.

The format must be: * projects/project_number/savedQueries/saved_query_id * folders/folder_number/savedQueries/saved_query_id * organizations/organization_number/savedQueries/saved_query_id About Cursors The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. . Each additional . moves it up one additional level. E.g. ... would go three levels up. Optional Output Flags The method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default. -o out out specifies the destination to which to write the server's result to.
