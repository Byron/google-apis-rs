By default all output is printed to standard out, but flags can be set to direct it into a file independent of your shell's capabilities. Errors will be printed to standard error, and cause the program's exit code to be non-zero. If data-structures are requested, these will be returned as pretty-printed JSON, to be useful as input to other tools. Everything else about the networkconnectivity API can be found at the official documentation site . Installation and Source Code Install the command-line interface with cargo using: cargo install google-networkconnectivity1-cli Find the source code on github .

Specify the authentication a method should be executed in. Each scope requires the user to grant this application permission to use it. If unset, it defaults to the shortest scope url for a particular method. --config-dir <folder> A directory into which we will store our persistent data. Defaults to a user-writable directory that we will create during the first invocation. [default: ~/.google-service-cli] Configuration The program will store all persistent data in the ~/.google-service-cli directory in JSON files prefixed with networkconnectivity1- . You can change the directory used to store configuration with the --config-dir flag on a per-invocation basis. More information about the various kinds of persistent data are given in the following paragraphs. Authentication Most APIs require a user to authenticate any request. If this is the case, the scope determines the set of permissions granted. The granularity of these is usually no more than read-only or full-access . If not set, the system will automatically select the smallest feasible scope, e.g. when invoking a method that is read-only, it will ask only for a read-only scope. You may use the --scope flag to specify a scope directly. All applicable scopes are documented in the respective method's CLI documentation. The first time a scope is used, the user is asked for permission. Follow the instructions given by the CLI to grant permissions, or to decline. If a scope was authenticated by the user, the respective information will be stored as JSON in the configuration directory, e.g. ~/.google-service-cli/networkconnectivity1-token-<scope-hash>.json . No manual management of these tokens is necessary. To revoke granted authentication, please refer to the official documentation . Application Secrets In order to allow any application to use Google services, it will need to be registered using the Google Developer Console . APIs the application may use are then enabled for it one by one. Most APIs can be used for free and have a daily quota. To allow more comfortable usage of the CLI without forcing anyone to register an own application, the CLI comes with a default application secret that is configured accordingly. This also means that heavy usage all around the world may deplete the daily quota. You can workaround this limitation by putting your own secrets file at this location: ~/.google-service-cli/networkconnectivity1-secret.json , assuming that the required networkconnectivity API was enabled for it. Such a secret file can be downloaded in the Google Developer Console at APIs & auth -> Credentials -> Download JSON and used as is. Learn more about how to setup Google projects and enable APIs using the official documentation . Debugging Even though the CLI does its best to provide usable error messages, sometimes it might be desirable to know what exactly led to a particular issue. This is done by allowing all client-server communication to be output to standard error as-is . The --debug flag will print errors using the Debug representation to standard error. You may consider redirecting standard error into a file for ease of use, e.g. networkconnectivity1 --debug <resource> <method> [options] 2>debug.txt .","title":"Home"},{"location":"#installation-and-source-code","text":"Install the command-line interface with cargo using: cargo install google-networkconnectivity1-cli Find the source code on github .","title":"Installation and Source Code"},{"location":"#usage","text":"This documentation was generated from the networkconnectivity API at revision 20240221 .

You can set the scope for this method like this: networkconnectivity1 --scope <scope> projects locations-global-hubs-accept-spoke ... Required Scalar Argument <name> (string) Required. The name of the hub into which to accept the spoke. Required Request Value The request value is a data-structure with various fields. Each field may be a simple scalar or another data-structure. In the latter case it is advised to set the field-cursor to the data-structure's field to specify values more concisely. For example, a structure like this: AcceptHubSpokeRequest: request-id: string spoke-uri: string can be set completely with the following arguments which are assumed to be executed in the given order. Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time. -r . request-id=et Optional. A request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server knows to ignore the request if it has already been completed. The server guarantees that a request doesn't result in creation of duplicate commitments for at least 60 minutes. For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check to see whether the original operation was received. If it was, the server ignores the second request. This behavior prevents clients from mistakenly creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID, with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). spoke-uri=magna Required. The URI of the spoke to accept into the hub. About Cursors The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. . Each additional . moves it up one additional level. E.g. ... would go three levels up.

Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time. -r . create-time=dolor Time when the internal range was created. description=duo A description of this resource. ip-cidr-range=vero The IP range that this internal range defines. labels=key=vero User-defined labels. the value will be associated with the given key name=invidunt Immutable. The name of an internal range. Format: projects/{project}/locations/{location}/internalRanges/{internal_range} See: https://google.aip.dev/122#fields-representing-resource-names network=stet The URL or resource ID of the network in which to reserve the internal range. The network cannot be deleted if there are any reserved internal ranges referring to it. Legacy networks are not supported. This can only be specified for a global internal address. Example: - URL: /compute/v1/projects/{project}/global/networks/{resourceId} - ID: network123 overlaps=vero Optional. Types of resources that are allowed to overlap with the current internal range. Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. peering=elitr The type of peering set for this internal range. prefix-length=95 An alternate to ip_cidr_range. Can be set when trying to create a reservation that automatically finds a free range of the given size. If both ip_cidr_range and prefix_length are set, there is an error if the range sizes do not match. Can also be used during updates to change the range size. target-cidr-range=diam Optional. Can be set to narrow down or pick a different address space while searching for a free range. If not set, defaults to the \"10.0.0.0/8\" address space. This can be used to search in other rfc-1918 address spaces like \"172.16.0.0/12\" and \"192.168.0.0/16\" or non-rfc-1918 address spaces used in the VPC. Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. update-time=no Time when the internal range was updated. usage=ipsum The type of usage set for this InternalRange. users=accusam Output only. The list of resources that refer to this internal range. Resources that use the internal range for their range allocation are referred to as users of the range. Other resources mark themselves as users while doing so by creating a reference to this internal range. Having a user, based on this reference, prevents deletion of the internal range referred to. Can be empty.

Required Scalar Argument <resource> (string) REQUIRED: The resource for which the policy is being specified. See Resource names for the appropriate value for this field. Required Request Value The request value is a data-structure with various fields. Each field may be a simple scalar or another data-structure. In the latter case it is advised to set the field-cursor to the data-structure's field to specify values more concisely. For example, a structure like this: SetIamPolicyRequest: policy: etag: string version: integer update-mask: string can be set completely with the following arguments which are assumed to be executed in the given order. Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time. -r .policy etag=sed etag is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help prevent simultaneous updates of a policy from overwriting each other. It is strongly suggested that systems make use of the etag in the read-modify-write cycle to perform policy updates in order to avoid race conditions: An etag is returned in the response to getIamPolicy , and systems are expected to put that etag in the request to setIamPolicy to ensure that their change will be applied to the same version of the policy. Important: If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the etag field whenever you call setIamPolicy . If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to overwrite a version 3 policy with a version 1 policy, and all of the conditions in the version 3 policy are lost. version=92 Specifies the format of the policy. Valid values are 0 , 1 , and 3 . Requests that specify an invalid value are rejected. Any operation that affects conditional role bindings must specify version 3 . This requirement applies to the following operations: * Getting a policy that includes a conditional role binding * Adding a conditional role binding to a policy * Changing a conditional role binding in a policy * Removing any role binding, with or without a condition, from a policy that includes conditions Important: If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the etag field whenever you call setIamPolicy . If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to overwrite a version 3 policy with a version 1 policy, and all of the conditions in the version 3 policy are lost. If a policy does not include any conditions, operations on that policy may specify any valid version or leave the field unset. To learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the IAM documentation . .. update-mask=dolores OPTIONAL: A FieldMask specifying which fields of the policy to modify. Only the fields in the mask will be modified. If no mask is provided, the following default mask is used: paths: &#34;bindings, etag&#34; About Cursors The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. .

Required Request Value The request value is a data-structure with various fields. Each field may be a simple scalar or another data-structure. In the latter case it is advised to set the field-cursor to the data-structure's field to specify values more concisely. For example, a structure like this: SetIamPolicyRequest: policy: etag: string version: integer update-mask: string can be set completely with the following arguments which are assumed to be executed in the given order. Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time. -r .policy etag=ipsum etag is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help prevent simultaneous updates of a policy from overwriting each other. It is strongly suggested that systems make use of the etag in the read-modify-write cycle to perform policy updates in order to avoid race conditions: An etag is returned in the response to getIamPolicy , and systems are expected to put that etag in the request to setIamPolicy to ensure that their change will be applied to the same version of the policy.

Required Scalar Argument <resource> (string) REQUIRED: The resource for which the policy is being specified. See Resource names for the appropriate value for this field. Required Request Value The request value is a data-structure with various fields. Each field may be a simple scalar or another data-structure. In the latter case it is advised to set the field-cursor to the data-structure's field to specify values more concisely. For example, a structure like this: SetIamPolicyRequest: policy: etag: string version: integer update-mask: string can be set completely with the following arguments which are assumed to be executed in the given order. Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time. -r .policy etag=ipsum etag is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help prevent simultaneous updates of a policy from overwriting each other. It is strongly suggested that systems make use of the etag in the read-modify-write cycle to perform policy updates in order to avoid race conditions: An etag is returned in the response to getIamPolicy , and systems are expected to put that etag in the request to setIamPolicy to ensure that their change will be applied to the same version of the policy. Important: If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the etag field whenever you call setIamPolicy . If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to overwrite a version 3 policy with a version 1 policy, and all of the conditions in the version 3 policy are lost. version=45 Specifies the format of the policy.
