By default all output is printed to standard out, but flags can be set to direct it into a file independent of your shell's capabilities. Errors will be printed to standard error, and cause the program's exit code to be non-zero. If data-structures are requested, these will be returned as pretty-printed JSON, to be useful as input to other tools. Everything else about the Firebase Management API can be found at the official documentation site . Installation and Source Code Install the command-line interface with cargo using: cargo install google-firebase1_beta1-cli Find the source code on github .

Specify the authentication a method should be executed in. Each scope requires the user to grant this application permission to use it. If unset, it defaults to the shortest scope url for a particular method. --config-dir <folder> A directory into which we will store our persistent data. Defaults to a user-writable directory that we will create during the first invocation. [default: ~/.google-service-cli] Configuration The program will store all persistent data in the ~/.google-service-cli directory in JSON files prefixed with firebase1-beta1- . You can change the directory used to store configuration with the --config-dir flag on a per-invocation basis. More information about the various kinds of persistent data are given in the following paragraphs. Authentication Most APIs require a user to authenticate any request. If this is the case, the scope determines the set of permissions granted. The granularity of these is usually no more than read-only or full-access . If not set, the system will automatically select the smallest feasible scope, e.g. when invoking a method that is read-only, it will ask only for a read-only scope. You may use the --scope flag to specify a scope directly. All applicable scopes are documented in the respective method's CLI documentation. The first time a scope is used, the user is asked for permission. Follow the instructions given by the CLI to grant permissions, or to decline. If a scope was authenticated by the user, the respective information will be stored as JSON in the configuration directory, e.g. ~/.google-service-cli/firebase1-beta1-token-<scope-hash>.json . No manual management of these tokens is necessary. To revoke granted authentication, please refer to the official documentation . Application Secrets In order to allow any application to use Google services, it will need to be registered using the Google Developer Console . APIs the application may use are then enabled for it one by one. Most APIs can be used for free and have a daily quota. To allow more comfortable usage of the CLI without forcing anyone to register an own application, the CLI comes with a default application secret that is configured accordingly. This also means that heavy usage all around the world may deplete the daily quota. You can workaround this limitation by putting your own secrets file at this location: ~/.google-service-cli/firebase1-beta1-secret.json , assuming that the required firebase API was enabled for it. Such a secret file can be downloaded in the Google Developer Console at APIs & auth -> Credentials -> Download JSON and used as is. Learn more about how to setup Google projects and enable APIs using the official documentation . Debugging Even though the CLI does its best to provide usable error messages, sometimes it might be desirable to know what exactly led to a particular issue. This is done by allowing all client-server communication to be output to standard error as-is . The --debug flag will print errors using the Debug representation to standard error. You may consider redirecting standard error into a file for ease of use, e.g. firebase1-beta1 --debug <resource> <method> [options] 2>debug.txt .","title":"Home"},{"location":"#installation-and-source-code","text":"Install the command-line interface with cargo using: cargo install google-firebase1_beta1-cli Find the source code on github .","title":"Installation and Source Code"},{"location":"#usage","text":"This documentation was generated from the Firebase Management API at revision 20240304 .

Since a FirebaseProject is actually also a GCP Project , a FirebaseProject has the same underlying GCP identifiers ( projectNumber and projectId ). This allows for easy interop with Google APIs. The result of this call is an Operation . Poll the Operation to track the provisioning process by calling GetOperation until done is true .

Then, as applicable, the data streams and apps are linked. Note that this auto-linking only applies to AndroidApps and IosApps . 2. If no corresponding data streams are found for the Firebase Apps, new data streams are provisioned in the Google Analytics property for each of the Firebase Apps. Note that a new data stream is always provisioned for a Web App even if it was previously associated with a data stream in the Analytics property. Learn more about the hierarchy and structure of Google Analytics accounts in the Analytics documentation . The result of this call is an Operation . Poll the Operation to track the provisioning process by calling GetOperation until done is true . When done is true , the Operation has either succeeded or failed. If the Operation succeeded, its response is set to an AnalyticsDetails; if the Operation failed, its error is set to a google.rpc.Status. To call AddGoogleAnalytics , a project member must be an Owner for the existing FirebaseProject and have the Edit permission for the Google Analytics account. If the FirebaseProject already has Google Analytics enabled, and you call AddGoogleAnalytics using an analyticsPropertyId that's different from the currently associated property, then the call will fail. Analytics may have already been enabled in the Firebase console or by specifying timeZone and regionCode in the call to AddFirebase . Scopes You will need authorization for at least one of the following scopes to make a valid call: https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform https://www.googleapis.com/auth/firebase If unset, the scope for this method defaults to https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform . You can set the scope for this method like this: firebase1-beta1 --scope <scope> projects add-google-analytics ... Required Scalar Argument <parent> (string) The resource name of the FirebaseProject to link to an existing Google Analytics account, in the format: projects/PROJECT_IDENTIFIER Refer to the FirebaseProject name field for details about PROJECT_IDENTIFIER values. Required Request Value The request value is a data-structure with various fields. Each field may be a simple scalar or another data-structure. In the latter case it is advised to set the field-cursor to the data-structure's field to specify values more concisely. For example, a structure like this: AddGoogleAnalyticsRequest: analytics-account-id: string analytics-property-id: string can be set completely with the following arguments which are assumed to be executed in the given order. Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time. -r . analytics-account-id=magna The ID for the existing Google Analytics account that you want to link with the FirebaseProject . Specifying this field will provision a new Google Analytics property in your Google Analytics account and associate the new property with the FirebaseProject . analytics-property-id=no The ID for the existing Google Analytics property that you want to associate with the FirebaseProject . About Cursors The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. . Each additional . moves it up one additional level. E.g. ... would go three levels up.
