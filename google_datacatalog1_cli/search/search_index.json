By default all output is printed to standard out, but flags can be set to direct it into a file independent of your shell's capabilities. Errors will be printed to standard error, and cause the program's exit code to be non-zero. If data-structures are requested, these will be returned as pretty-printed JSON, to be useful as input to other tools. Everything else about the Data Catalog API can be found at the official documentation site . Installation and Source Code Install the command-line interface with cargo using: cargo install google-datacatalog1-cli Find the source code on github .

Specify the authentication a method should be executed in. Each scope requires the user to grant this application permission to use it. If unset, it defaults to the shortest scope url for a particular method. --config-dir <folder> A directory into which we will store our persistent data. Defaults to a user-writable directory that we will create during the first invocation. [default: ~/.google-service-cli] Configuration The program will store all persistent data in the ~/.google-service-cli directory in JSON files prefixed with datacatalog1- . You can change the directory used to store configuration with the --config-dir flag on a per-invocation basis. More information about the various kinds of persistent data are given in the following paragraphs. Authentication Most APIs require a user to authenticate any request. If this is the case, the scope determines the set of permissions granted. The granularity of these is usually no more than read-only or full-access . If not set, the system will automatically select the smallest feasible scope, e.g. when invoking a method that is read-only, it will ask only for a read-only scope. You may use the --scope flag to specify a scope directly. All applicable scopes are documented in the respective method's CLI documentation. The first time a scope is used, the user is asked for permission. Follow the instructions given by the CLI to grant permissions, or to decline. If a scope was authenticated by the user, the respective information will be stored as JSON in the configuration directory, e.g. ~/.google-service-cli/datacatalog1-token-<scope-hash>.json . No manual management of these tokens is necessary. To revoke granted authentication, please refer to the official documentation . Application Secrets In order to allow any application to use Google services, it will need to be registered using the Google Developer Console . APIs the application may use are then enabled for it one by one. Most APIs can be used for free and have a daily quota. To allow more comfortable usage of the CLI without forcing anyone to register an own application, the CLI comes with a default application secret that is configured accordingly. This also means that heavy usage all around the world may deplete the daily quota. You can workaround this limitation by putting your own secrets file at this location: ~/.google-service-cli/datacatalog1-secret.json , assuming that the required datacatalog API was enabled for it. Such a secret file can be downloaded in the Google Developer Console at APIs & auth -> Credentials -> Download JSON and used as is. Learn more about how to setup Google projects and enable APIs using the official documentation . Debugging Even though the CLI does its best to provide usable error messages, sometimes it might be desirable to know what exactly led to a particular issue. This is done by allowing all client-server communication to be output to standard error as-is . The --debug flag will print errors using the Debug representation to standard error. You may consider redirecting standard error into a file for ease of use, e.g. datacatalog1 --debug <resource> <method> [options] 2>debug.txt .","title":"Home"},{"location":"#installation-and-source-code","text":"Install the command-line interface with cargo using: cargo install google-datacatalog1-cli Find the source code on github .","title":"Installation and Source Code"},{"location":"#usage","text":"This documentation was generated from the Data Catalog API at revision 20240222 .

This is a [Custom Method] (https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/custom_methods) that doesn't return all information on a resource, only its ID and high level fields. To get more information, you can subsequently call specific get methods. Note: Data Catalog search queries don't guarantee full recall. Results that match your query might not be returned, even in subsequent result pages. Additionally, returned (and not returned) results can vary if you repeat search queries. For more information, see [Data Catalog search syntax] (https://cloud.google.com/data-catalog/docs/how-to/search-reference). Scopes You will need authorization for the https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform scope to make a valid call. If unset, the scope for this method defaults to https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform . You can set the scope for this method like this: datacatalog1 --scope <scope> catalog search ... Required Request Value The request value is a data-structure with various fields. Each field may be a simple scalar or another data-structure. In the latter case it is advised to set the field-cursor to the data-structure's field to specify values more concisely. For example, a structure like this: GoogleCloudDatacatalogV1SearchCatalogRequest: admin-search: boolean order-by: string page-size: integer page-token: string query: string scope: include-gcp-public-datasets: boolean include-org-ids: [string] include-project-ids: [string] include-public-tag-templates: boolean restricted-locations: [string] starred-only: boolean can be set completely with the following arguments which are assumed to be executed in the given order. Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time. -r . admin-search=true Optional. If set, use searchAll permission granted on organizations from include_org_ids and projects from include_project_ids instead of the fine grained per resource permissions when filtering the search results. The only allowed order_by criteria for admin_search mode is default . Using this flags guarantees a full recall of the search results. order-by=voluptua. Specifies the order of results. Currently supported case-sensitive values are: * relevance that can only be descending * last_modified_timestamp [asc|desc] with descending ( desc ) as default * default that can only be descending Search queries don't guarantee full recall. Results that match your query might not be returned, even in subsequent result pages. Additionally, returned (and not returned) results can vary if you repeat search queries. If you are experiencing recall issues and you don't have to fetch the results in any specific order, consider setting this parameter to default . If this parameter is omitted, it defaults to the descending relevance . page-size=74 Upper bound on the number of results you can get in a single response. Can't be negative or 0, defaults to 10 in this case. The maximum number is 1000. If exceeded, throws an \"invalid argument\" exception. page-token=sanctus Optional. Pagination token that, if specified, returns the next page of search results. If empty, returns the first page. This token is returned in the SearchCatalogResponse.next_page_token field of the response to a previous SearchCatalogRequest call. query=sed Optional. The query string with a minimum of 3 characters and specific syntax. For more information, see Data Catalog search syntax . An empty query string returns all data assets (in the specified scope) that you have access to. A query string can be a simple xyz or qualified by predicates: * name:x * column:y * description:z scope include-gcp-public-datasets=true If true , include Google Cloud public datasets in search results. By default, they are excluded. See Google Cloud Public Datasets for more information. include-org-ids=amet. The list of organization IDs to search within. To find your organization ID, follow the steps from [Creating and managing organizations] (/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-organization). Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. include-project-ids=duo The list of project IDs to search within. For more information on the distinction between project names, IDs, and numbers, see Projects . Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. include-public-tag-templates=true Optional. This field is deprecated. The search mechanism for public and private tag templates is the same. restricted-locations=gubergren Optional. The list of locations to search within. If empty, all locations are searched. Returns an error if any location in the list isn't one of the Supported regions . If a location is unreachable, its name is returned in the SearchCatalogResponse.unreachable field. To get additional information on the error, repeat the search request and set the location name as the value of this parameter. Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. starred-only=true Optional. If true , search only among starred entries. By default, all results are returned, starred or not. About Cursors The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. . Each additional . moves it up one additional level. E.g. ... would go three levels up. Optional Output Flags The method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default. -o out out specifies the destination to which to write the server's result to. It will be a JSON-encoded structure. The destination may be - to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes. If unset, it defaults to standard output. Optional General Properties The following properties can configure any call, and are not specific to this method. -p $-xgafv=string V1 error format. -p access-token=string OAuth access token. -p alt=string Data format for response. -p callback=string JSONP -p fields=string Selector specifying which fields to include in a partial response. -p key=string API key. Your API key identifies your project and provides you with API access, quota, and reports. Required unless you provide an OAuth 2.0 token. -p oauth-token=string OAuth 2.0 token for the current user. -p pretty-print=boolean Returns response with indentations and line breaks. -p quota-user=string Available to use for quota purposes for server-side applications. Can be any arbitrary string assigned to a user, but should not exceed 40 characters. -p upload-type=string Legacy upload protocol for media (e.g. \"media\", \"multipart\"). -p upload-protocol=string Upload protocol for media (e.g. \"raw\", \"multipart\").","title":"Search"},{"location":"catalog_search/#scopes","text":"You will need authorization for the https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform scope to make a valid call.

About Cursors The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. . Each additional . moves it up one additional level. E.g. ... would go three levels up.

Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time. -r .policy etag=diam etag is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help prevent simultaneous updates of a policy from overwriting each other. It is strongly suggested that systems make use of the etag in the read-modify-write cycle to perform policy updates in order to avoid race conditions: An etag is returned in the response to getIamPolicy , and systems are expected to put that etag in the request to setIamPolicy to ensure that their change will be applied to the same version of the policy. Important: If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the etag field whenever you call setIamPolicy . If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to overwrite a version 3 policy with a version 1 policy, and all of the conditions in the version 3 policy are lost. version=91 Specifies the format of the policy. Valid values are 0 , 1 , and 3 . Requests that specify an invalid value are rejected. Any operation that affects conditional role bindings must specify version 3 . This requirement applies to the following operations: * Getting a policy that includes a conditional role binding * Adding a conditional role binding to a policy * Changing a conditional role binding in a policy * Removing any role binding, with or without a condition, from a policy that includes conditions Important: If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the etag field whenever you call setIamPolicy .
