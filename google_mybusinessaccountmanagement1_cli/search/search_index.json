By default all output is printed to standard out, but flags can be set to direct it into a file independent of your shell's capabilities. Errors will be printed to standard error, and cause the program's exit code to be non-zero. If data-structures are requested, these will be returned as pretty-printed JSON, to be useful as input to other tools. Everything else about the My Business Account Management API can be found at the official documentation site . Installation and Source Code Install the command-line interface with cargo using: cargo install google-mybusinessaccountmanagement1-cli Find the source code on github .

Defaults to a user-writable directory that we will create during the first invocation. [default: ~/.google-service-cli] Configuration The program will store all persistent data in the ~/.google-service-cli directory in JSON files prefixed with mybusinessaccountmanagement1- . You can change the directory used to store configuration with the --config-dir flag on a per-invocation basis. More information about the various kinds of persistent data are given in the following paragraphs. Authentication Most APIs require a user to authenticate any request. If this is the case, the scope determines the set of permissions granted. The granularity of these is usually no more than read-only or full-access . If not set, the system will automatically select the smallest feasible scope, e.g. when invoking a method that is read-only, it will ask only for a read-only scope. You may use the --scope flag to specify a scope directly. All applicable scopes are documented in the respective method's CLI documentation. The first time a scope is used, the user is asked for permission. Follow the instructions given by the CLI to grant permissions, or to decline. If a scope was authenticated by the user, the respective information will be stored as JSON in the configuration directory, e.g. ~/.google-service-cli/mybusinessaccountmanagement1-token-<scope-hash>.json . No manual management of these tokens is necessary. To revoke granted authentication, please refer to the official documentation . Application Secrets In order to allow any application to use Google services, it will need to be registered using the Google Developer Console . APIs the application may use are then enabled for it one by one. Most APIs can be used for free and have a daily quota. To allow more comfortable usage of the CLI without forcing anyone to register an own application, the CLI comes with a default application secret that is configured accordingly. This also means that heavy usage all around the world may deplete the daily quota. You can workaround this limitation by putting your own secrets file at this location: ~/.google-service-cli/mybusinessaccountmanagement1-secret.json , assuming that the required mybusinessaccountmanagement API was enabled for it. Such a secret file can be downloaded in the Google Developer Console at APIs & auth -> Credentials -> Download JSON and used as is. Learn more about how to setup Google projects and enable APIs using the official documentation . Debugging Even though the CLI does its best to provide usable error messages, sometimes it might be desirable to know what exactly led to a particular issue. This is done by allowing all client-server communication to be output to standard error as-is . The --debug flag will print errors using the Debug representation to standard error. You may consider redirecting standard error into a file for ease of use, e.g. mybusinessaccountmanagement1 --debug <resource> <method> [options] 2>debug.txt .","title":"Home"},{"location":"#installation-and-source-code","text":"Install the command-line interface with cargo using: cargo install google-mybusinessaccountmanagement1-cli Find the source code on github .","title":"Installation and Source Code"},{"location":"#usage","text":"This documentation was generated from the My Business Account Management API at revision 20240304 .

Required Request Value The request value is a data-structure with various fields. Each field may be a simple scalar or another data-structure. In the latter case it is advised to set the field-cursor to the data-structure's field to specify values more concisely. For example, a structure like this: Account: account-name: string account-number: string name: string organization-info: address: address-lines: [string] administrative-area: string language-code: string locality: string organization: string postal-code: string recipients: [string] region-code: string revision: integer sorting-code: string sublocality: string phone-number: string registered-domain: string permission-level: string primary-owner: string role: string type: string verification-state: string vetted-state: string can be set completely with the following arguments which are assumed to be executed in the given order. Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time. -r . account-name=duo Required. The name of the account. For an account of type PERSONAL , this is the first and last name of the user account. account-number=ipsum Output only. Account reference number if provisioned. name=gubergren Immutable. The resource name, in the format accounts/{account_id} . organization-info.address address-lines=lorem Unstructured address lines describing the lower levels of an address. Because values in address_lines do not have type information and may sometimes contain multiple values in a single field (e.g. \"Austin, TX\"), it is important that the line order is clear. The order of address lines should be \"envelope order\" for the country/region of the address. In places where this can vary (e.g. Japan), address_language is used to make it explicit (e.g. \"ja\" for large-to-small ordering and \"ja-Latn\" or \"en\" for small-to-large). This way, the most specific line of an address can be selected based on the language. The minimum permitted structural representation of an address consists of a region_code with all remaining information placed in the address_lines. It would be possible to format such an address very approximately without geocoding, but no semantic reasoning could be made about any of the address components until it was at least partially resolved. Creating an address only containing a region_code and address_lines, and then geocoding is the recommended way to handle completely unstructured addresses (as opposed to guessing which parts of the address should be localities or administrative areas). Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. administrative-area=gubergren Optional. Highest administrative subdivision which is used for postal addresses of a country or region. For example, this can be a state, a province, an oblast, or a prefecture. Specifically, for Spain this is the province and not the autonomous community (e.g. \"Barcelona\" and not \"Catalonia\"). Many countries don't use an administrative area in postal addresses. E.g. in Switzerland this should be left unpopulated. language-code=eos Optional. BCP-47 language code of the contents of this address (if known). This is often the UI language of the input form or is expected to match one of the languages used in the address' country/region, or their transliterated equivalents. This can affect formatting in certain countries, but is not critical to the correctness of the data and will never affect any validation or other non-formatting related operations. If this value is not known, it should be omitted (rather than specifying a possibly incorrect default). Examples: \"zh-Hant\", \"ja\", \"ja-Latn\", \"en\". locality=dolor Optional. Generally refers to the city/town portion of the address. Examples: US city, IT comune, UK post town. In regions of the world where localities are not well defined or do not fit into this structure well, leave locality empty and use address_lines. organization=ea Optional. The name of the organization at the address. postal-code=ipsum Optional. Postal code of the address. Not all countries use or require postal codes to be present, but where they are used, they may trigger additional validation with other parts of the address (e.g. state/zip validation in the U.S.A.). recipients=invidunt Optional. The recipient at the address. This field may, under certain circumstances, contain multiline information. For example, it might contain \"care of\" information. Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. region-code=amet Required. CLDR region code of the country/region of the address. This is never inferred and it is up to the user to ensure the value is correct. See https://cldr.unicode.org/ and https://www.unicode.org/cldr/charts/30/supplemental/territory_information.html for details. Example: \"CH\" for Switzerland. revision=81 The schema revision of the PostalAddress . This must be set to 0, which is the latest revision. All new revisions must be backward compatible with old revisions. sorting-code=ipsum Optional. Additional, country-specific, sorting code. This is not used in most regions. Where it is used, the value is either a string like \"CEDEX\", optionally followed by a number (e.g. \"CEDEX 7\"), or just a number alone, representing the \"sector code\" (Jamaica), \"delivery area indicator\" (Malawi) or \"post office indicator\" (e.g. C\u00f4te d'Ivoire). sublocality=sed Optional. Sublocality of the address. For example, this can be neighborhoods, boroughs, districts. .. phone-number=ut Output only. The contact number for the organization. registered-domain=gubergren Output only. The registered domain for the account. .. permission-level=rebum. Output only.

Accounts of type PERSONAL and ORGANIZATION cannot be created using this API. verification-state=est Output only. If verified, future locations that are created are automatically connected to Google Maps, and have Google+ pages created, without requiring moderation. vetted-state=gubergren Output only. Indicates whether the account is vetted by Google. A vetted account is able to verify locations via the VETTED_PARTNER method. About Cursors The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. . Each additional . moves it up one additional level. E.g. ... would go three levels up. Optional Output Flags The method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default. -o out out specifies the destination to which to write the server's result to.

Required Request Value The request value is a data-structure with various fields. Each field may be a simple scalar or another data-structure. In the latter case it is advised to set the field-cursor to the data-structure's field to specify values more concisely. For example, a structure like this: Account: account-name: string account-number: string name: string organization-info: address: address-lines: [string] administrative-area: string language-code: string locality: string organization: string postal-code: string recipients: [string] region-code: string revision: integer sorting-code: string sublocality: string phone-number: string registered-domain: string permission-level: string primary-owner: string role: string type: string verification-state: string vetted-state: string can be set completely with the following arguments which are assumed to be executed in the given order. Note how the cursor position is adjusted to the respective structures, allowing simple field names to be used most of the time. -r . account-name=ea Required. The name of the account. For an account of type PERSONAL , this is the first and last name of the user account. account-number=dolor Output only. Account reference number if provisioned. name=lorem Immutable. The resource name, in the format accounts/{account_id} . organization-info.address address-lines=eos Unstructured address lines describing the lower levels of an address. Because values in address_lines do not have type information and may sometimes contain multiple values in a single field (e.g. \"Austin, TX\"), it is important that the line order is clear. The order of address lines should be \"envelope order\" for the country/region of the address. In places where this can vary (e.g. Japan), address_language is used to make it explicit (e.g. \"ja\" for large-to-small ordering and \"ja-Latn\" or \"en\" for small-to-large). This way, the most specific line of an address can be selected based on the language. The minimum permitted structural representation of an address consists of a region_code with all remaining information placed in the address_lines. It would be possible to format such an address very approximately without geocoding, but no semantic reasoning could be made about any of the address components until it was at least partially resolved. Creating an address only containing a region_code and address_lines, and then geocoding is the recommended way to handle completely unstructured addresses (as opposed to guessing which parts of the address should be localities or administrative areas). Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. administrative-area=labore Optional. Highest administrative subdivision which is used for postal addresses of a country or region. For example, this can be a state, a province, an oblast, or a prefecture. Specifically, for Spain this is the province and not the autonomous community (e.g. \"Barcelona\" and not \"Catalonia\"). Many countries don't use an administrative area in postal addresses. E.g. in Switzerland this should be left unpopulated. language-code=sed Optional. BCP-47 language code of the contents of this address (if known). This is often the UI language of the input form or is expected to match one of the languages used in the address' country/region, or their transliterated equivalents. This can affect formatting in certain countries, but is not critical to the correctness of the data and will never affect any validation or other non-formatting related operations. If this value is not known, it should be omitted (rather than specifying a possibly incorrect default). Examples: \"zh-Hant\", \"ja\", \"ja-Latn\", \"en\". locality=duo Optional. Generally refers to the city/town portion of the address. Examples: US city, IT comune, UK post town. In regions of the world where localities are not well defined or do not fit into this structure well, leave locality empty and use address_lines. organization=sed Optional. The name of the organization at the address. postal-code=no Optional. Postal code of the address. Not all countries use or require postal codes to be present, but where they are used, they may trigger additional validation with other parts of the address (e.g. state/zip validation in the U.S.A.). recipients=stet Optional. The recipient at the address. This field may, under certain circumstances, contain multiline information. For example, it might contain \"care of\" information. Each invocation of this argument appends the given value to the array. region-code=kasd Required. CLDR region code of the country/region of the address. This is never inferred and it is up to the user to ensure the value is correct. See https://cldr.unicode.org/ and https://www.unicode.org/cldr/charts/30/supplemental/territory_information.html for details. Example: \"CH\" for Switzerland. revision=77 The schema revision of the PostalAddress . This must be set to 0, which is the latest revision. All new revisions must be backward compatible with old revisions. sorting-code=sed Optional. Additional, country-specific, sorting code. This is not used in most regions. Where it is used, the value is either a string like \"CEDEX\", optionally followed by a number (e.g. \"CEDEX 7\"), or just a number alone, representing the \"sector code\" (Jamaica), \"delivery area indicator\" (Malawi) or \"post office indicator\" (e.g. C\u00f4te d'Ivoire). sublocality=et Optional. Sublocality of the address. For example, this can be neighborhoods, boroughs, districts. .. phone-number=et Output only. The contact number for the organization. registered-domain=vero Output only. The registered domain for the account. .. permission-level=erat Output only. Specifies the permission level the user has for this account. primary-owner=sed Required. Input only. The resource name of the account which will be the primary owner of the account being created. It should be of the form accounts/{account_id} . role=duo Output only. Specifies the AccountRole of this account. type=dolore Required. Contains the type of account. Accounts of type PERSONAL and ORGANIZATION cannot be created using this API. verification-state=et Output only. If verified, future locations that are created are automatically connected to Google Maps, and have Google+ pages created, without requiring moderation. vetted-state=voluptua. Output only. Indicates whether the account is vetted by Google. A vetted account is able to verify locations via the VETTED_PARTNER method. About Cursors The cursor position is key to comfortably set complex nested structures. The following rules apply: The cursor position is always set relative to the current one, unless the field name starts with the . character. Fields can be nested such as in -r f.s.o . The cursor position is set relative to the top-level structure if it starts with . , e.g. -r .s.s You can also set nested fields without setting the cursor explicitly. For example, to set a value relative to the current cursor position, you would specify -r struct.sub_struct=bar . You can move the cursor one level up by using .. . Each additional . moves it up one additional level. E.g. ... would go three levels up. Optional Output Flags The method's return value a JSON encoded structure, which will be written to standard output by default. -o out out specifies the destination to which to write the server's result to. It will be a JSON-encoded structure. The destination may be - to indicate standard output, or a filepath that is to contain the received bytes. If unset, it defaults to standard output.
